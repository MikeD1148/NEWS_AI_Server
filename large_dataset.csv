"This video can not be played Robert Jenrick's plans to use military bases ""being disposed of"" face criticism from both sides of the Commons. Three sites including two ex-military bases will be used as migrant housing in a bid to cut down on hotel use. Sites in Lincolnshire and Essex, plus another in East Sussex, could house ""several thousand"", Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick said. The government is ""exploring the possibility"" of using ferries but no firm decision has been taken, he said. Labour shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the announcement was ""an admission of failure"" on asylum policy. The plans are likely to meet local opposition and have been criticised by MPs whose constituencies are impacted, with one Conservative warning the government a legal challenge would be launched. Mr Jenrick told the Commons ""the sheer number of small boats have overwhelmed the asylum system"" and said the government would ""not elevate the wellbeing of illegal migrants above the British people"". ""Accommodation for migrants should meet essential living needs and nothing more, because we cannot risk becoming a magnet for the millions of people who are displaced and seeking better economic prospects,"" he added. Mr Jenrick said the three new sites will help reduce the need to rely on private hotels but conceded that ""these sites on their own will not end the use of hotels overnight"". He also revealed barracks at Catterick Garrison in Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's constituency was being assessed for suitability as potential accommodation. Later, bosses of a commercial port on the Dorset coast in southern England said the Home Office had asked it to provide space for an ""accommodation facility"". Bill Reeves, chief executive of Portland Port, said: ""We are currently liaising with the Home Office about the next steps."" Conservative-led Dorset Council has said it has ""serious concerns"" about the location. There had been media speculation the government could announce plans to use vessels to house migrants, but it wasn't included in what the minister called the ""first tranche"" of housing options. The government says £6.2m a day is being spent on hotels for migrants and areas with high concentrations of people face a strain on local services. The BBC understands more than 51,000 people are currently being housed in 395 hotels.  Mr Jenrick said new funding would be made available for local authorities to help deal with costs. This video can not be played Plans include housing migrants at RAF Wethersfield in Essex The BBC understands necessary planning changes has been secured to repurpose military sites in Lincolnshire and Essex, and both could be used to house people who enter the country illegally within weeks. Mr Jenrick did not name the individual sites during his Commons statement but their locations have previously been reported. Use of RAF Scampton - home of the Dambusters squadron during World War Two - near Scampton, Lincolnshire, could trigger a legal challenge. Its local Tory MP, Sir Edward Leigh, criticised the choice as a ""thoroughly bad idea"" and said the local authority would launch an immediate judicial review. A deal was agreed in March to allow West Lindsey District Council buy the base from the Ministry of Defence as part of a £300m regeneration project of the site for commercial activity, heritage, tourism and research. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly has previously criticised plans to house people at the base near the village of Wethersfield in his Essex constituency of Braintree. He said the site was ""inappropriate"" because it was remote and had limited transport infrastructure. The local authority has confirmed it is considering legal action. Former home secretary Priti Patel, who represents a neighbouring constituency, has also questioned the site's suitability. Bexhill and Battle MP Huw Merriman identified the East Sussex site as Northeye near Bexhill, which formerly housed an RAF property, a prison and a training centre. Government sources say each site will be able to house between 1,500 and 2,000 migrants, and initially are more likely to be used for new arrivals rather than to rehouse people currently in hotels.  Mr Jenrick said the sites would be used to house single adult males and stressed it was not his ""intention"" that minors will be taken there.  The current system of housing asylum seekers in hotels is deeply unpopular with many Conservative MPs. But the alternatives are also unpopular with a few. The lack of detail on exactly what the government is ""exploring"" by way of options for using ferries and barges certainly looks like it's caused some jitters. It was noted that several Tory MPs with ports or docks in their areas spoke out against the plans. It's also allowed the opposition to question if the much-trailed idea is really a runner at all. As for the two military sites, the opposition from local councils is fierce and seems it may be headed for the courts. The dilemma isn't going away though: people going through the asylum system need somewhere to live. The government has pinned its reputation on dealing with this issue so the prospect of some local fights, however fierce, is unlikely to put it off. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the government's announcement was an ""admission of failure"" and not a proposal to cut or provide an alternative to ""costly hotel use"". ""They've got this huge backlog of asylum decisions, so much so that 98% of last year's small boats arrivals simply haven't even been decided or processed."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has accused the government of ""going after headlines"" while failing to solve the problem of people arriving in small boats. The Refugee Council believes the accommodation being suggested is ""entirely unsuitable"" to the needs of asylum seekers.  Alex Fraser, from the British Red Cross, said: ""Military sites, by their very nature, can re-traumatise people who have fled war and persecution"". Mr Sunak told his cabinet on Tuesday the cost of the current approach and pressure it put on local areas was not sustainable, according to No 10.  At a Commons liaison committee, the prime minister said children cannot be exempted from plans to detain people who cross the Channel in small boats to prevent the creation of a ""pull factor"". It comes as the government's asylum proposals laid out in the Illegal Migration Bill are being debated in Parliament.  The legislation aims to stop migrants claiming asylum in the UK if they arrive through unauthorised means, by crossing the English Channel in small boats.  People could be detained without bail or judicial review for 28 days before being removed to their home country or a safe third country like Rwanda.

"Barristers for Associated Newspapers have argued to a High Court judge that Prince Harry and six other well-known people have run out of time to bring privacy claims against the Mail titles. The law requires that claims are brought within six years. But some of the allegations against Associated date back decades. Lawyers for the claimants - also including Sir Elton John and Baroness Doreen Lawrence - argue that new evidence has recently come to light. The newspaper publisher said ""they haven't come close"" to proving that only now could they sue the Mail and Mail on Sunday.  Last year, the seven claimants said they had only recently become aware of ""compelling and highly distressing evidence that they had been the victims of abhorrent criminal activity and gross breaches of privacy by Associated Newspapers"".  This included, they said, evidence that the publisher's journalists paid private investigators for bugging cars and homes, listening to private telephone calls, paying police officials and obtaining medical and financial records. In the case of the Duke of Sussex, his witness statement published on Tuesday stresses that he was not told by lawyers acting for the Royal Family of the possibility of suing newspapers. He said he only realised this when press interest grew around his relationship with his now wife, which was when he started talking to a senior Royal Family lawyer. At the Leveson Inquiry in 2011, the Mail's editor Paul Dacre swore on oath that his journalists had not used illegal methods of gathering information.  The lawyers for the claimants say legal action was prevented because of these denials.  They are now arguing that the clock for bringing a legal action only started when the new evidence came to light.  But Adrian Beltrami KC for Associated Newspapers argued that the claimants should have complained about articles in the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday at the time they were published.  He told the judge, Mr Justice Nicklin, that there was no new evidence which justified lifting the time restriction on bringing a case.  Ledgers kept by the newspapers of payments to private investigators could not be used to prove the case because they had been leaked from a public inquiry, he said, referring to a legal disagreement the judge will have to resolve.  Even if they were valid as evidence, the claimants could have obtained them years ago, he said.  In the same way, admissions by private investigators that they worked for Mail titles in the 1990s and 2000s were not new.  Turning to a ""handful"" of documents he said were being used to suggest Mail journalists had commissioned illegal activities, Mr Beltrami asked: ""Are they the tipping point?"" ""If this is supposed to be the tipping point they can not bear the weight which is attributed to them,"" he said. If the judge decides in favour of the newspapers, the case could be brought to an end long before it comes to a trial.

By Josh Parry, LGBT reporter Whenever we talk about on-screen representation, there's a saying; ""If you can't see it, you can't be it."" And as tributes to Paul O'Grady pour in, it's clear the saying has never been more appropriate. He played pubs and clubs as rough-around-the-edges drag queen Lily savage in the 80s, and brought the character to the mainstream in the 90s. But it was what Paul did next - and how he did it - that made him a trailblazer for gay representation on screen and inspired a whole generation of entertainers that might not ever have thought it possible. As Britain emerged from the AIDs crisis,  with homophobia and stigma still rife, Paul managed to become a staple of prime-time light entertainment; not just as Lily, but as himself. A working class gay man from Birkenhead. He never assimilated. He never attempted to ""straighten up"" or change his persona. And for so many in the LGBT community - who are used to making ourselves smaller or hiding parts of our personality in certain company - that was a game changer. From documentaries, to his own chat shows, the Blind Date reboot and of course his ITV show Love of Dogs, he never dimmed himself down or tried to make himself more palatable for certain audiences. He was unapologetically camp, and bitchy. He was Paul - perhaps, though, always with a hint of Lily… O'Grady was also mentioned by several MPs during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions.

""He exploded through the daft, made-up rules of society. He was a massive talent, but you can't forget he was a social worker when he was younger, he saved babies and young children from abuse, he lived in Soho before it was gentrified, he never judged the vulnerable, the weak, the misunderstood."" O'Grady had recently been on tour playing Miss Hannigan in the musical Annie and had been due to present on Boom Radio in less than two weeks time for Easter Sunday.  The presenter was born in Birkenhead, on the Wirral, Merseyside, in 1955, to a mother whose maiden name was Savage - which is believed to have inspired his famous drag act.  He began performing as Lily Savage in the 1970s. His drag persona later helmed in a solo show that ran for eight years at London's Royal Vauxhall Tavern, and made a name by speaking out about LGBT issues. Later, he hosted chat show The Lily Savage Show for BBC for a short run in 1997, before turning his hand to hosting a revived version of game show Blankety Blank, which remained on air until 2002.  O'Grady later hosted teatime programme The Paul O'Grady Show on ITV from 2004 to 2005, before moving with it to Channel 4 from 2006 until 2009. It was later revived in 2013 on ITV and remained on air for two years.  During 2013, the chat show was fronted by guest hosts after he suffered a health scare. He had previously had heart attacks in 2002 and 2006, the latter requiring a stay in intensive care.  During his career O'Grady won a TV Bafta, British Comedy Award and a National Television Award for The Paul O'Grady Show.

"This video can not be played Watch: A timelapse movie of Patagotitan's assembly at the Natural History Museum A colossus has landed in London: A cast of what was one of the biggest animals ever to walk the Earth is now on show at the Natural History Museum. Patagotitan was a dinosaur that lived 100 million years ago in South America. Measuring some 37m (121ft) from nose to tail, the beast could have weighed up to 60 or 70 tonnes in life. The museum has brought over not just a representative skeleton but some of the real fossil bones first discovered in Argentina in 2014. The largest is a 2.4m-long femur, or thigh bone. It's been erected upright to give visitors an extraordinary selfie opportunity. ""Patagotitan was what we call a sauropod dinosaur,"" explained palaeontologist Prof Paul Barrett.  ""It's a relative of things like Diplodocus that you might be a bit more familiar with. It's one of these large barrel-bodied animals with forced-out legs. It almost looks like a giant elephant that's had an anaconda snake threaded through it, with a very long neck and a long tail,"" he told BBC News. The replica skeleton is on loan from Argentina's Museo Paleontológico Egidio Feruglio (MEF), whose staff unearthed the original fossils.  This video can not be played Prof Paul Barrett: ""They turned their bodies into huge fermentation tanks"" The London institution had to put its thinking cap on to work out how best to display the creature. It only just fits in its Waterhouse Gallery, its largest exhibition space. Even then, the end of the tail has had to be bent around a column. The floor also needed to be strengthened, but, cleverly, engineers have been able to hide some of the supporting armature, or support frame, so that it looks as though the dinosaur is walking along the carpet.  ""It's been quite the challenge, second only to hanging our blue whale from the ceiling in the museum's Hintze Hall,"" said head of technical production, Jez Burn. The cast is accompanied by lots of interactive videos and games that explain the life stories of the exceptionally large sauropods that lived in the Cretaceous Period of Earth history.  Who exactly was the biggest of these titanosaurs is difficult to say, but animals like Patagotitan and another creature called Argentinosaurus were right up there. ""What's incredible about Patagotitan is the amount of the dinosaur that was found,"" said exhibition developer Sinéad Marron.   ""The other giant dinosaurs are known from just a few fragments of bones, whereas the skeleton of Patagotitan is known from a couple of hundred bones from at least six different individuals. We simply know more about Patagotitan than all the other giants."" Scientists are unsure why the titanosaurs were so big, but they have a good idea as to how they developed their immense bulk. This probably had something to do with the relatively poor quality plant food available to them, which required a large digestive system to get the most out of it. Essentially, they were giant fermentation tanks on sturdy legs. Visitors will get to squeeze some tubes intended to simulate a titanosaur's intestines. Prepare to be shocked by the beast's tummy rumbles. An animal as big as Patagotitan would have had to eat all day and most of the night to sustain itself.  By one calculation, the animal could have consumed over 130kg of plants every day. This is equivalent to approximately 515 round lettuces.  No wonder scientists describe titanosaurs as ""ecosystem engineers"". As they moved across the landscape, they would have cleared all vegetation in front of them. Imagine the slurry production... from a whole herd.  It's a yucky thought but with it would have come the mass processing and shifting of nutrients, along with the dispersal of countless seeds.  The influence on the environment and the lives of all animals around at the time would have been profound. The exhibition - Titanosaur: Life as the Biggest Dinosaur - opens on Friday and runs until 7 January next year. It is a ticketed event.

"A man has been found guilty of murdering a 71-year-old who mistook his home for a B&B and got into his bed. Margaret Barnes, from Birmingham, died following the attack last July while she was visiting Barmouth, Gwynedd.  David Redfern, 46, found Mrs Barnes asleep in his bedroom and dragged her downstairs by her feet before kicking and stamping her to death. Redfern denied murder but was found guilty after a trial at Caernarfon Crown Court. Mrs Barnes had been out drinking with friends and had been planning to stay at a B&B on Marine Parade, where Redfern lived. She mistakenly went into Redfern's house and went straight to his bedroom and fell asleep. Michael Jones, prosecuting, described that as a ""mistake that ultimately cost her her life"".  After returning home and finding Mrs Barnes in his bed, Redfern, who had self-confessed anger issues, dragged her downstairs by her ankles. Redfern, a 6ft 1in (1.85m) man who weighed 21 stone (133kg), then kicked and stamped on Mrs Barnes, breaking numerous ribs. She died at the scene.  A post-mortem examination found she had a traumatic liver injury and extensive internal bleeding. In police bodycam footage shown during the trial, Redfern said: ""I threw her out the bedroom, dragged her down the stairs by her ankles and threw her out the door. ""You do not expect to find someone else in your bed. I just wanted to get this strange woman out of the house."" In CCTV footage, Redfern is heard telling his partner: ""I didn't mean to kill her"". His partner replied: ""You could have just escorted her out. It's an old lady."" Redfern told the jury when he and his fiancée came into the room, they found Mrs Barnes sitting up in their bed drinking gin and tonic with her false teeth on the bedside table. Redfern claimed Mrs Barnes became aggressive and lunged at his partner after the couple called the police. After dragging Mrs Barnes downstairs Redfern delivered a ""deliberate, gratuitous, and forceful"" kick or stamp to her. Redfern claimed there was accidental contact during the confrontation and accepted saying ""some appalling things"" but always maintained he was not responsible for her death. A pathologist told the jury Mrs Barnes' injuries were the sort they would expect to see in a car crash. Mrs Barnes collapsed outside the front door of Redfern's home, where he mocked her as she complained of chest pains before losing consciousness. Despite the efforts of neighbours and paramedics, she could not be revived and was pronounced dead in the early hours of 11 July. The jury found Redfern guilty of a single charge of murder after deliberating for 15 hours. Addressing Redfern, Mr Justice Bourne said he must expect a life sentence when he is sentenced on Friday, with the minimum time he must serve to be decided. After the trial, Mrs Barnes' family said she was a much-loved wife, mother and grandmother. ""As a family it has been the hardest time of our lives,"" they said. ""It has been especially difficult for Margaret's husband who had been her partner for 56 years. ""We now have some sort of closure on what has happened however no length of sentence will ever fill the void that Margaret has left behind.""

"Mould and a broken toilet were just some of the problems Chiara said she and her family faced in their rented home over the past two years.  But when the teacher complained to her landlord, she said they responded with a no-fault eviction notice. It comes as a survey found tenants in England who complain to landlords were more than twice as likely to get an eviction notice than those who do not. It has renewed calls to scrap no-fault evictions, known as Section 21 notices. The government pledged to ban the use of Section 21 orders in England last June, but since then the number of households threatened with homelessness because of such notices has increased by 34%.   Shelter, a major housing charity, said that scrapping no-fault evictions was more urgent than ever, especially with the number of homes available to rent in the UK dropping by a third over the past 18 months. Chiara told the BBC that she, her husband Ben and their three-year-old daughter Maggie had ""lived with disrepair for two years"" in a flat in Leyton, London. ""We had moths in the carpet, the cellar was flooded, we had no bath, the toilet broke so we had no toilet,"" she said. With mould and damp also causing problems, Chiara complained about the state of the flat to her landlord. ""They responded with a Section 21, giving us two months' notice to vacate the property,"" she said.  ""We were kicked out because we complained."" Chiara, who is a teacher in Walthamstow, said that after they got the notice in January, the family experienced a frantic search to find a new home, finally moving into a new place two weeks ago. She said while searching they discovered that rents had surged. Chiara said it made it ""pretty much impossible"" for them to find another two-bed flat with a garden, so now the family has moved into a one-bed. According to a YouGov survey of just over 2000 private renting adults in England commissioned by charity Shelter, tenants facing issues with properties who then complained about disrepair to their landlord were more than twice as likely to be handed an eviction notice than those who had not. The research found that 76% of private renters in England have experienced disrepair in the last year, and a quarter of renters have not asked for repairs to be carried out due to fear of eviction. ""We just need to get rid of Section 21,"" said Polly Neate, Shelter's chief executive. She added there needed to be a ""situation where landlords can evict people for legitimate reasons, and can't evict them just because they complain about the poor condition of their home"". David and Samira from Richmond in North Yorkshire have had a similar experience to Chiara and her family. The couple were issued with a no-fault eviction just before Christmas after complaining about damp. Samira was six months' pregnant at the time.  David said the eviction was ""really unfair"" and caused a lot of stress for the parents-to-be. ""Looking at the options we had as tenants there was very little we could do. It was just really baffling, really confusing, it doesn't seem like a fair process,"" David added, after being outbid or rejected for more than 30 properties they had viewed. ""Soul destroying is the term I'd use for it, it was just rejection after rejection after rejection."" David and Samira managed to find a new home just in time for the arrival of their daughter Aila last week.  The government is due to introduce a Renters' Reform Bill before the summer, which it has said will redress the balance in the market and provide more security for tenants. Housing rules are different in each of the devolved nations, and Scotland and Wales have already banned no fault evictions.

"Key figures in artificial intelligence want training of powerful AI systems to be suspended amid fears of a threat to humanity. They have signed an open letter warning of potential risks, and say the race to develop AI systems is out of control. Twitter chief Elon Musk is among those who want training of AIs above a certain capacity to be halted for at least six months. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and some researchers at DeepMind also signed. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, recently released GPT-4 - a state-of-the-art technology, which has impressed observers with its ability to do tasks such as answering questions about objects in images. The letter, from Future of Life Institute and signed by the luminaries, wants development to be halted temporarily at that level, warning in their letter of the risks future, more advanced systems might pose. ""AI systems with human-competitive intelligence can pose profound risks to society and humanity,"" it says. The Future of Life Institute is a not-for-profit organisation which says its mission is to ""steer transformative technologies away from extreme, large-scale risks and towards benefiting life"".  This video can not be played Watch: What is artificial intelligence? Mr Musk, owner of Twitter and chief executive of car company Tesla, is listed as an external adviser to the organisation. Advanced AIs need to be developed with care, the letter says, but instead, ""recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no-one - not even their creators - can understand, predict, or reliably control"". The letter warns that AIs could flood information channels with misinformation, and replace jobs with automation. The letter follows a recent report from investment bank Goldman Sachs which said that while AI was likely to increase productivity, millions of jobs could become automated. However, other experts told the BBC the effect of AI on the labour market was very hard to predict.  More speculatively, the letter asks: ""Should we develop non-human minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete [sic] and replace us?"" In a recent blog post quoted in the letter, OpenAI warned of the risks if an artificial general intelligence (AGI) were developed recklessly: ""A misaligned superintelligent AGI could cause grievous harm to the world; an autocratic regime with a decisive superintelligence lead could do that, too. ""Co-ordination among AGI efforts to slow down at critical junctures will likely be important,"" the firm wrote. OpenAI has not publicly commented on the letter. The BBC has asked the firm whether it backs the call. Mr Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI - though he resigned from the board of the organisation some years ago and has tweeted critically about its current direction.  Autonomous driving functions made by his car company Tesla, like most similar systems, use AI technology. The letter asks AI labs ""to immediately pause for at least six months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4"". If such a delay cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium, it says. ""New and capable regulatory authorities dedicated to AI"" would also be needed.  Recently, a number of proposals for the regulation of technology have been put forward in the US, UK and EU. However, the UK has ruled out a dedicated regulator for AI.

"A man who killed a fellow passenger with a horseshoe after a row about music being played on their train has been found guilty of murder. Kirkpatrick Virgo attacked Thomas Parker, 24, on a platform at Reading station after the journey on 30 July. It followed an argument between the pair after one of Virgo's friends was told to turn the music down. Virgo, 42, from Slough, had previously admitted manslaughter and carrying an offensive weapon but denied murder. During a trial at Reading Crown Court, the jury heard the row started at about 23:00 GMT when Mr Parker's brother Craig, 27, asked for the volume of the music to be lowered. The two groups shouted at each other before the altercation was ended by off-duty police officers. Virgo then followed the Parker brothers after the train arrived at Reading station, the jury was told. Craig Parker told the court he went to be sick behind a pillar after feeling ill from a McDonald's milkshake he had consumed during the journey. ""Once I vomited I felt Tom looking over me, making sure I was all right,"" he said, adding: ""Then it happened, so quickly, Tom was on the floor in front of me."" The court heard Virgo had followed the group, removing a heavy metallic horseshoe from his rucksack, which he then used to hit Thomas Parker in the head. Virgo told jurors he bought the horseshoe as a ""lucky charm"" from an antiques shop and was carrying it because he had not got round to hanging it on a door. He claimed he was spat at and racially abused by Thomas Parker who he feared was going to attack him. Described by his family as ""loving and funny"", British Transport Police (BTP) said the victim had been on his way home from a match between Arsenal and Sevilla at the Emirates Stadium in London. CCTV footage showed Virgo and two friends boarding the same train at Slough carrying a boom box and accounts taken from witnesses stated they were playing loud music, the force said in a statement. During the argument, passengers heard Virgo remark: ""Do you want to die tonight?"" Following the attack, Craig Parker chased Virgo through the station, catching him on the concourse and tackling him to the floor in a ""bear hug"" before rail staff intervened and alerted emergency services. After Virgo was detained, Mr Parker said he heard someone tell him: ""You best come down now."" He returned to find his brother surrounded by paramedics. The victim, a golf greenkeeper, was pronounced dead at the scene at 00:40 BST. Speaking after the verdict, Det Ch Insp Paul Langley, from BTP, said Mr Parker was a young man with his whole life ahead of him. ""But that life was taken away by an extremely violent individual who fatally struck him following a disagreement,"" he said. ""Thanks to a single shocking act of violence by Kirkpatrick Virgo, Tom's family now face the rest of their lives without their brother, son and friend."" Virgo will be sentenced at the same court on Friday.  Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. Send your story ideas to south.newsonline@bbc.co.uk.

"The UK is at risk of losing jobs and investment in the ""net-zero race"", senior cross-party MPs have warned. The government is set to announce its revised energy strategy on Thursday. It argues the UK is a ""world-leader"" in working towards net-zero. But cross-party MPs fear investors - and jobs - could move elsewhere if the strategy is not ambitious enough. A Department for Business and Trade official said the government was having ""almost daily"" conversations with companies so they know the UK is committed to supporting green technology. Why is the government outlining yet another energy and net-zero strategy, when it had one last year? In part, it's out of necessity. In July 2022, the High Court ruled its existing net-zero strategy ""unlawful"" for not showing how the UK will hit legally binding carbon targets.   Ministers also want to produce a plan for how UK net-zero policies can help grow the economy - one of the prime minister's priorities, even if net-zero is not.   They also need to respond to a government-commissioned net-zero review by Conservative MP Chris Skidmore.   It said the UK was ""falling behind"" on some climate targets, needed to be more ambitious, and should speed up the rollout of renewable energy, heat pumps, and insulation among other recommendations.  It's not though, I'm told by government insiders, meant to be the UK's response to a huge green subsidies programme in the US yet - that'll come later - which is concerning some climate-watchers in Westminster.  Reaching net-zero is often dubbed a ""race"".   Not just against time - with the impacts of climate change becoming more apparent - but economically too.   In the US, President Biden has introduced a multi-billion dollar package - the Inflation Reduction Act - to speed up the production of green technology such as solar panels and wind turbines and to subsidise people to make environmentally friendly purchases like electric cars.   Billions of dollars are being given to communities who have suffered most from fossil fuel production.   Extra tax incentives are also on offer for businesses investing in green jobs and technology in low-income areas.   The EU has responded with plans for a Net Zero Industry Act to increase subsidies for green industry.   The US's move has vocal critics in the UK government.  Business and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch has described it as ""protectionist"", Energy Secretary Grant Shapps as ""dangerous"".  Some fear it's given the US an unfair competitive advantage, and that it's an attempt to lure high-tech manufacturing companies to the US.   Some electric car and wind turbine manufacturers, among others, are already looking to relocate - taking good jobs with them, from areas of the UK that need them.   The government claims its existing plans to invest in renewable and nuclear technologies will support up to 480,000 green jobs and secure up to £100bn of private investment by 2030.   A Department of Business and Trade official told the BBC Ms Badenoch will bring forward an ""Advanced Manufacturing Plan"" in the coming months to make the UK a more competitive place for green industries to do business and ""one of the best places in the world to manufacture electric vehicles and develop critical supply chain technologies"".  They added that the government was having daily conversations with companies in this space.  The chancellor also said at the budget he'd use his Autumn Statement to ""complete our response to the challenges created by the US Inflation Reduction Act"".  But opposition parties, as well as some business leaders, green groups and Conservatives, fear time is running out to respond to the US's ambition. The independent climate think tank E3G said the government's decision not to announce any new public investment or tax breaks for green industry in the Budget was a ""disappointment"" to UK business.   The £20bn for carbon capture storage over 10 years was previously announced in 2022.   Labour's shadow climate change and net-zero secretary Ed Miliband has argued for a British equivalent of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and a national wealth fund to invest in green technology alongside the private sector.   ""We need to stop moaning about the IRA and start matching its ambition,"" he said.   Mr Shapps has accused Labour of having a ""£28bn plan for borrowing, nothing more"". More concerning for the government may be some of the critics in its own ranks.   Mr Skidmore, who authored the government's net-zero review, told the BBC: ""We have a vanishingly small window to act. There is a net-zero race, there are net-zero markets that will go elsewhere.""   He added that the ""real risk"" on Thursday is that if the government does not provide certainty that ""demonstrates that this is a place to invest"" then ""investors will say this doesn't deliver"".  ""From Thursday they will begin to take strategic decision to go elsewhere.""   Thursday is not a ""fiscal event"" or Budget, so it's not expected new investment will be announced.  But Mr Skidmore said this is not just about money, but also demonstrating how welcoming the UK's planning and regulation systems are to green infrastructure.   For example, current planning rules make it very hard to build new onshore wind turbines and there are concerns the UK's national grid - electricity network - needs more capacity to accommodate further renewable energy. ""Ultimately,"" he said, ""investors will look at what is being proposed and say 'yes this is a country we can do business' or move elsewhere.""   It's a sentiment echoed by the UK's former COP26 President Alok Sharma, who said: ""We are fast approaching a crossroads.""   The Tory MP added that the US Inflation Reduction Act was attracting billions of dollars of private sector investment in green industries and that the government must set out a meaningful response like financial incentives on Thursday or ""we can allow others to win this critical race"".  He said mixed signals of delayed delivery of policies will ""not cut the mustard"" for businesses. The government insists it is committed to net-zero, making it easier for supportive communities to host onshore wind farms, growing solar capacity and doubling hydrogen production.   But it has said the government will seek to make use of North Sea oil and gas reserves as the UK transitions to cleaner energy.   A decision on whether to approve the new Rosebank oil and gas field in the North Sea may be made on Thursday - along with announcements on hydrogen, energy efficiency, electric cars and moving from gas boilers to heat pumps.   Green groups and MPs critical, and supportive, of net-zero alike will pour over the detail.   But some argue the key political judgement for the government will come from the business community.   If any decide it doesn't go far enough, get impatient, and up sticks, it could prove difficult to claw them back - and MPs warn that could have environmental and economic consequences for years to come.

"The Metropolitan Police has said it is no longer investigating allegations of sexual assault against a Tory MP. Julian Knight, who was suspended from the parliamentary Conservative Party over the case, had always denied the allegations. The Tory whips office said it would not restore Mr Knight as a Tory MP following ""further complaints"". Mr Knight has claimed he is the victim of a ""continuing a witch hunt against me"" by the whips. A spokesperson for the Chief Whip Simon Hart said: ""Following further complaints made to the Whips' Office, we will not be restoring the whip to Julian Knight. ""These complaints, if appropriate, will be referred to the relevant police force, or appropriate bodies."" Mr Knight said the statement from the whips ""smacks of a desperate attempt to cover up the identities and motives of those in Parliament who colluded for many months to bring the false allegation against me to the police"". ""The whips office now seems intent on continuing a witch hunt against me in an attempt to prevent my naming names,"" he added. An investigation was launched after police received allegations of serious sexual assault. Scotland Yard received an allegation on 28 October last year, before a further referral relating to the incident was made on 7 December. In a statement, the police said they are no longer proceeding with an investigation and there have been no arrests. Mr Knight said he was not interviewed by the police, in a statement released before the whips office announced that he would not return to sit as a Conservative MP. He said: ""The fact is that there was never anything for the police to investigate. This was a single, false and malicious allegation initially brought to them by third parties, each of whom had their own clear motives for doing so."" He said the Conservative whips office ""acted disgracefully and in breach of natural justice"" in ""publicly naming me in connection with the allegation"". ""Their actions meant my name was dragged through the mud and my good reputation immeasurably damaged,"" Mr Knight said. He added: ""Had the police taken the simple step at outset of interviewing me under caution, they would have seen that the allegation was false and scandalous. Instead, they waited four months, without ever talking to me, before deciding there was nothing for them to investigate. ""I have been left effectively to prove my innocence through my public statements and letters to the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and the Chief Whip. That cannot be right. ""It is now my intention to use every legal route available to pursue those inside and outside Parliament involved in having this allegation brought against me.""

"There have been further attacks on properties in County Down in a dispute between rival factions of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Detectives said there were petrol bomb attacks on a house in Bangor and a block of flats in Newtownards. No one was injured in Tuesday evening's attacks, which police say are connected to a row between two drug gangs.  Up to 12 attacks in recent days are thought to be linked and there has been a large police presence in north Down. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said officers were called at 21:20 BST on Tuesday to a petrol bomb attack on a house in Ballyferris Walk, Bangor. Officers then received a report of damage to a property in Glenbrook Road in Newtownards. At least two men threw a brick through the front window and poured petrol onto the driveway, the PSNI said. At 21:40 there was a petrol bomb attack at a block of flats in Donaghadee Road, Newtownards. ""These incidents are linked to an ongoing feud between two rival drug gangs and police are following a number of lines of enquiry,"" said a police spokesperson. On Monday, police said eight other houses had been attacked since last Wednesday, and many of those were occupied. Officers said those attacks were linked to an ongoing feud between ""two rival drug gangs operating under the banner of the Ulster Defence Association in the North Down and Ards areas"". The UDA was formed during the Troubles but began to splinter into criminal gangs once the conflict ended. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) assembly member (MLA) Mike Nesbitt said the dispute in north Down and Newtownards involved people ""who are in it for themselves to line their pockets, to exercise coercive control over their community and for prestige"". He said the violence was doing a ""disservice"" to loyalism and Northern Ireland's international reputation ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. His party colleague Philip Smith, who leads the UUP group on Ards and North Down Borough Council, told BBC's Evening Extra programme that the area struggled with police resources at the best of times. Mr Smith urged Chief Constable Simon Byrne to ensure the district commander had all the necessary resources. ""We can not have these type of incidents taking place and the police not being able to respond in the numbers that they need,"" he said. Nick Mathison, Alliance MLA for Strangford, also condemned the attacks. He said the perpetrators were ""organised crime gangs that need to be taken off the streets and dealt with through the courts"". Alex Easton, an independent unionist MLA for North Down, called on other unionist leaders to do more to try to stop the violence. Mr Easton said unionist leaders had a responsibility to show leadership and that it would help if they came out and condemned what had happened.  ""Unionist leaders all have a responsibility, and this is one of them, we need to get this stopped before someone gets killed,"" he said. This is the continuation of the feud between two UDA factions in north Down which really surfaced in the last week. We have had around a dozen attacks in little under a week and there is a pattern to these attacks. In all but one, petrol bombs have been used and there have been attacks against properties rather than individuals. You could argue, given that we are talking about attacks on property, there hasn't been a serious and deadly escalation in this feud  -  loyalist feuds in the past saw gun attacks and murders. There has been an immediate police response, three people have been arrested, some of them held under the Terrorism Act and this action is an attempt to disrupt what is happening. There are no suggestions, at present, that this could escalate into other areas under UDA control. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme on Tuesday, DUP MLA Emma Little-Pengelly said there was ""absolutely no space"" for paramilitary or terrorism-related criminal behaviour in Northern Ireland.  Ms Little-Pengelly was also questioned on the fact that the Loyalist Communities Council (LCC) had made no comment following the attacks at the weekend.  She said: ""The DUP have always made clear that we want to engage with people but we will do so constructively. ""We will do so while making it absolutely clear that any paramilitarism or terrorism or criminal gang behaviour is wrong. ""The LCC are clearly in place to talk about the issues happening within communities - they may well be coming out with some sort of statement... I don't know. I'm not across the internal dealings within that organisation."" The LCC was set up in 2015 as a means to help bring an end to loyalist paramilitarism. It is not a proscribed organisation and is said to represent a range of individuals and views from the wider Protestant/unionist/loyalist community. The Ulster Defence Association, formed in 1971, had tens of thousands of members at its peak. It killed hundreds of people during the Troubles in Northern Ireland and often claimed responsibility for sectarian murders using the cover name the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF). The UDA remained a legal organisation until it was banned in August 1992. Notorious attacks by the UFF included the shooting dead of five Catholics at a Belfast bookmakers in 1992 and the Greysteel massacre the following year. The South East Antrim Ulster Defence Association is a standalone faction of the UDA and was once part of its inner council. Security sources have previously said that with more than 2,000 members, it is one of Northern Ireland's largest paramilitary gangs. According to a previous MI5-police intelligence assessment, the South East Antrim UDA""has access to arms and is heavily involved in drugs supply, community coercion, intimidation and other criminality.

"US President Joe Biden has said he still plans to visit Northern Ireland despite MI5's decision to increase the terrorism threat level to ""severe"". The move follows a rise in dissident republican activity, including a recent gun attack on a top police officer. Mr Biden was asked by reporters on Tuesday if it would affect his upcoming visit to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. ""No. They can't keep me out,"" he said. President Biden has been a vocal supporter of the peace deal signed on 10 April 1998, which was designed to bring an end to three decades of conflict in Northern Ireland. Following a meeting with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in March, Mr Biden said he intended to visit both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland as part of the anniversary celebrations.  Full details of Mr Biden's visit are yet to be confirmed, but the White House has said the increased threat level ""does not have any potential implications for future travel"". Former US President Bill Clinton, ex-British Prime Minister Tony Blair and former Taoiseach (Irish PM) Bertie Ahern are among those expected to visit Northern Ireland for commemorative events. MI5, rather than the PSNI or the government, is responsible for setting the Northern Ireland terrorism threat level, which it has been publishing since 2010. The move reverses a downgrade in Northern Ireland's terror threat level last March - its first change for 12 years. On Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said the rise in the threat level was ""disappointing"". However, Mr Raab said it is worth nothing that the number of dissident republican attacks has been in significant decline since its peak in 2009 and 2010. He was responding to a question from DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who asked for assurance the government would provide the PSNI and the security services with the resources they need to counter the threat. MI5, the UK's Security Service, is believed to review the threat level every six months.  The terrorism threat level remains substantial in the rest of the UK, meaning an attack is a strong possibility. In a written statement to MPs, Mr Heaton-Harris said: ""The public should remain vigilant, but not be alarmed, and continue to report any concerns they have to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI)."" Deputy Chief Constable Mark Hamilton said dissident republicans were focused on attacking police officers, not the public. ""You should be worried for your police service,"" he said. ""I wouldn't encourage people to be hugely concerned about their own safety broader than that."" In February Det Ch Insp John Caldwell was shot several times by two gunmen as he was putting footballs into his car boot having been coaching a youth training session in Omagh. On Tuesday, police said the 48-year-old father-of-one had been moved out of intensive care for the first time but remained in a serious condition. The attack on him was admitted by the New IRA, the biggest and most active group dissident group, whose main areas of operations are in Londonderry and County Tyrone. The group was formed in 2012 and previous security assessments estimated it had about 500 supporters, some 100 of whom are prepared to commit acts of terrorism. Although tensions within loyalist groups have led to attacks in parts of County Down in the past few days, the change to the threat level is not related to this flare up. Several loyalist paramilitary groups - the largest being the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defence Association - are active in Northern Ireland but are not considered a threat to national security and therefore are not a factor in MI5's assessment.

"A blind man will be paid £3,000 after he alleged a health trust failed to accommodate his needs when he tried to apply for a promotion. Stephen Campbell took a disability discrimination case against two organisations, including his employer the Western Health Trust. He claimed the job application process did not meet his needs as a blind man. The Western Health Trust and the HSC Business Services Organisation (BSO) did not accept liability. A spokesperson for the Western Trust said the organisation was committed to ensuring everyone has ""equality of access"" to its services. Mr Campbell, who worked in the trust's ICT department, uses a screen reader to interact with laptops. When an opportunity for promotion arose within the trust, Mr Campbell wanted to apply. However, he found that the online process, on the Health and Social Care Northern Ireland (HSCNI) website, could not be activated by his screen reader. He also could not find any information on where reasonable adjustments could be made so he could apply.  As part of the settlement terms, both organisations confirmed their commitment to ensuring they comply with their obligations under relevant equality laws. The BSO also said it would keep the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) updated on development of the HSCNI website.  Mr Campbell said: ""For two job applications, the Western Trust did accommodate me by stalling the recruitment exercise and reasonable adjustments were made to facilitate me."" He said he brought the case ""to raise awareness of the issue and hopefully remove this barrier to accessing employment for disabled people in the health service here"". Mr Campbell further told BBC News NI that it was ""frankly embarrassing"" he had to take the case. ""In this day and age, in public bodies and in the private sector, we shouldn't have to encounter these issues. We should be able to apply for posts like our sighted counterparts,"" he said. The Western Trust said it would work with the Equality Commission on policies around the recruitment process for blind people. The spokesperson added: ""The trust's HR department will always strive to support individuals who need assistance through a recruitment process, as we did on a number of occasions for Mr Campbell."" Eoin O'Neill, director of legal services at the Equality Commission, said the employment rate for disabled people in Northern Ireland at 36%, is the lowest in the UK.  He said Mr Campbell's case will benefit other disabled people in reminding organisations to ensure they are as accessible to disabled people as possible.

"Shona Robison is to replace Kate Forbes as Scotland's finance secretary after new First Minister Humza Yousaf announced his first cabinet. Ms Robison has been given the finance brief as well as serving as deputy first minister.  She is a close friend of former first minister Nicola Sturgeon.  Ms Robison was responsible for introducing the controversial gender reforms in her previous role as social justice secretary. The announcement came as Mr Yousaf unveiled his new cabinet team after being formally sworn as first minister in a brief ceremony at the Court of Session. Other key appointments include Michael Matheson taking over from Mr Yousaf as health secretary, while former transport minister Jenny Gilruth will join the full cabinet for the first time as education secretary. Another cabinet newcomer, Mairi McAllan, will be the net zero and just transition secretary at the age of just 30. And Neil Gray, who led Mr Yousaf's SNP leadership campaign, also joins the cabinet after being given responsibility for the wellbeing economy, fair work and energy briefs. The SNP's deputy leader, Keith Brown, has been replaced by Angela Constance as the country's justice secretary.  The remaining three members of the nine-strong cabinet team are: Ms Forbes, who was narrowly defeated by Mr Yousaf in the SNP leadership contest, announced on Tuesday that she was leaving the government.  She had been offered a new role by Mr Yousaf that would have given her Ms Gougeon's rural affairs job rather than finance - which would generally be viewed as a demotion - but turned it down. The new cabinet team has five members under the age of 40 and, for the first time, has a majority of women. Mr Yousaf said it reflected the priorities that the government will pursue, including tackling child poverty, improving public services and building a fairer, greener economy. He added: ""I have committed myself to a radical, ambitious and progressive policy agenda for Scotland - and I know that this team is the right one to deliver it. ""As we make the case for Scottish independence, we will continue to govern well and demonstrate to the people of Scotland the benefits of decisions about their lives being taken here in Scotland."" Mr Yousaf said he wanted a government that looked as much as possible like the people it represented, but insisted that all of his appointments had been made on merit.  He also paid tribute to those ministers who are now departing government - including Nicola Sturgeon and her deputy John Swinney. And he said he was disappointed that Ms Forbes was not in his cabinet as ""she's a great talent, she's somebody who has got a lot to give"". During the SNP leadership campaign Mr Yousaf said he favoured a ""big tent"" rather than ""inner circle"" approach to making key decisions and has pledged to bring the party back together again after deep divisions were exposed by the contest. He faced withering criticism of his own ministerial record from Ms Forbes in a live STV debate, while her views on issues such as gender recognition reform and gay marriage led the Scottish Greens to question whether they could work with her. Given the narrow margin of his victory over Ms Forbes, by 52.1% to 47.9%, some of her supporters had urged Mr Yousaf to keep her in government.   BBC Scotland  said he understands that Ms Forbes felt the SNP's partnership agreement with the Scottish Greens would have ""tied her hands and cost her dearly in her constituency"" if she had taken the rural affairs job. It emerged earlier on Wednesday that Ivan McKee, who had been the business minister under Nicola Sturgeon, will also leave the government after being offered a new role that he regarded as a demotion.  Mr McKee had initially been campaign manager for Ms Forbes in the leadership contest but stepped back from that role after early controversies in her campaign. Humza Yousaf has opted for a balance of youth and experience in his cabinet. This is underlined by the way he has split the finance portfolio between his deputy Shona Robison - an MSP since 1999 and a veteran of several government posts - and a fresher face in Neil Gray, who takes on the economy brief. Angela Constance and Michael Matheson both know their way around government, and have been handed two of the trickier jobs in justice and health. But perhaps the stiffest task has been reserved for cabinet newbie Jenny Gilruth, the former teacher who must now attempt to close the attainment gap - a task which eluded a succession of education secretaries including John Swinney. There are one or two glaring absences though. Keith Brown is out as justice secretary, two years after returning to government. He will presumably go back to focusing on his post as deputy leader of the SNP, with big changes in the offing at party HQ. And the absence of Kate Forbes may make it harder for Mr Yousaf to pull the party back together, given how close she ran him in the leadership contest. Scottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie described the new cabinet team as ""dismal"" and said it ""cements the SNP's new status as a deeply divided party led by B-rate politicians"". She added: ""The first minister promised to bring the country together, but he can't even bring his own party together. Loyalty is being rewarded over talent - but both are in short supply in the SNP.  ""At the heart of this continuity government are some of the most incompetent politicians of the last decade, set to deliver more of the same failure."" Scottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy said: ""This is a cabinet in Humza Yousaf's image - failed, continuity ministers appointed by a failed, continuity minister.  ""The likes of Shona Robison, Michael Matheson, Angela Constance and Jenny Gilruth have been found sorely wanting in previous ministerial roles, yet all have been 'rewarded' with promotion by the new first minister.""

"One of Scotland's main police control rooms used a fake system to manipulate response time targets for eight years, according to documents seen by the BBC. Thousands of calls to the Bilston Glen control room were allocated to a fictitious call sign known as DUMY. Internal systems would register that the calls had been passed to officers - but instead they were parked on a list. This meant a police vehicle would not have been dispatched quickly to calls which had been judged as high priority. It appears that many calls were not attended at all. The practice, according to official police documents, was designed to ""provide artificial levels of incident management performance"". The documents reveal that the DUMY call sign was used at Bilston Glen in Loanhead, Midlothian, from at least 2007 until the system was discovered in 2015 and stopped. Police Scotland said the practice should not have been used after the creation of the national police force in 2013, and was ""permanently discontinued"" in March 2015. The practice appears to have ended just four months before the M9 tragedy in July 2015. Lamara Bell and John Yuill died after their car lay undiscovered for three days after a crash, despite police being alerted. Police Scotland was criminally prosecuted and admitted that failures in its call handling processes at Bilston Glen contributed to the death of Ms Bell.  The lawyer who acted for one of the bereaved families has told the BBC they were never told about the DUMY process. David Nellaney, of Digby Brown, said this was information which should have been disclosed to the families. He added: ""I'm astonished to be perfectly honest. I think that puts the wider public at risk if calls are not being actioned… and to not respond to them and put them into a DUMY system whereby there's no guarantee that they'll come back to them, is quite shocking. ""I think it probably gives an indication of potentially the practices that were going on. When you adopt that type of practice you're bringing in factors such as human error, which have played a part in what happened with Lamara and John."" Moi Ali, who was on the board of the Scottish Police Authority watchdog from 2013 to 2017, said this was the first time she had heard of the system. ""These are exactly the kind of things that should be flagged to the board so that we can start an internal investigation or inquiry,"" she said. ""So if that was concealed from us, I find that very, very concerning."" Two heavily-redacted documents were released to BBC Scotland after a lengthy Freedom of Information (FOI) process with Police Scotland. An undated official misconduct document says an officer was being disciplined for conduct which ""discredits the Police Service or public confidence in it"". It states that staff at Bilston Glen utilised a ""fictitious call sign known as 'DUMY', which had been introduced to prevent the activation of internal alarms and provide artificial levels of incident management performance.""  Each police car is given a four letter or number call-sign, which is used to allocate the calls which are received by the force. When a call was given to DUMY, the system would recognise that it had been allocated successfully - but instead, these calls were parked on a separate list. This would help artificially inflate the centre's call-handling response times. These internal targets were not published, but the then Chief Constable Stephen House was known to be target-driven, and staff have previously spoken about the pressure to meet them. Stephen House has been approached for comment. A report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland (HMICS) - the independent body which scrutinised Police Scotland - highlighted understaffing as one of the issues which contributed to the control room's problems around the time of the M9 crash.  However, the HMICS investigation into the call-handling process at Bilston Glen makes no mention of the DUMY system. A HMICS spokesperson told the BBC its inquiry ""did not include a retrospective inspection of historical practices before this period"" and declined to say whether or not it knew about the practice. A second briefing document, dated 28 July 2015, reveals that the DUMY practice was in use at the Lothian and Borders force from at least 2007, and continued for two years after the country's regional forces merged into Police Scotland in 2013. It states that being placed on the DUMY list would cause the incident ""to go to the bottom of the controller's incident list"". The practice was halted briefly in January 2015, when the control system was being upgraded to a new system known as Storm Unity, and the DUMY call sign was no longer available.  But staff at Bilton Glen ""lobbied"" senior management to re-introduce it to the new system, and this was approved by a senior person whose name and title has been redacted on the documents.  The DUMY system was up and running for another six weeks before a member of the Glasgow control room noticed and raised the alarm. In December last year, the BBC learned that Police Scotland chiefs had been so worried about the DUMY practice that they launched an internal investigation, led by then Ch Supt Paul Anderson.  We asked Police Scotland, under FOI, to provide a copy of his report. It told the BBC that it ""does not hold a copy of the report requested"". However, Mr Anderson, now a Deputy chief constable at Humberside Police, confirmed to the BBC that he did in fact carry out an investigation, and produced a report.  A spokesman for Mr Anderson told the BBC he ""undertook a review on request of the chief officer team. The review pertained to an allocation practice in a particular call centre.  ""A report was completed with recommendations made. The subject of the report and its findings is a matter for Police Scotland to formally comment on."" The BBC asked Police Scotland whether it had shredded the report. The force said it no longer holds the report, in line with its data retention policy. One of the documents Police Scotland did release includes a table of how many calls were allocated to the DUMY call sign in the six weeks between 9 February and 21 March 2015. Calls are graded when they come in to the control room in order to decide how they should be handled.  A priority one call is designated as ""immediate"" and described as ""an ongoing incident where there is an immediate or apparent threat to life or a serious crime in progress"". Police Scotland targets stipulate that a police car must be dispatched within five minutes.  A priority two call is designated as ""priority"" and described as an incident ""where there is a degree of urgency associated with police action"". priority two calls should be dispatched with 15 minutes. It appears that 101 priority one calls were allocated to the DUMY call sign during that six-week period. This suggests none was dispatched within the five-minute target. The table suggests only 29 of these calls were attended at all.  In the same period 822 priority two calls were allocated to DUMY. The table suggests only 238 of these were attended.  If the numbers for that six-week period were averaged out over the eight years, it would suggest around 7,000 priority one calls were allocated to the DUMY call sign, with around a third actually being attended. Using the same extrapolation, more than 50,000 priority two calls may have been allocated to the DUMY call sign, with around a third being attended.  The briefing paper says that all the priority one incidents ""are currently being viewed in order to confirm that there are no unresolved incidents remaining in the system"". It adds: ""Direction on the requirement for a review of all DUMY incidents is sought from senior management."" Moi Ali said the DUMY system sounded like ""an attempt at deception"". ""I think it cuts to the very heart of public trust and confidence in policing,"" she said. ""When you're at your most vulnerable and you dial 999, you really expect to get a quick service."" A Police Scotland spokesperson said: ""The DUMY call sign was a practice which had been in use by one legacy service since 1997 to assist controllers to allocate resource during periods of high demand. ""The practice should not have continued under Police Scotland and local use of the call sign in one service centre was halted in January 2015 when a new command and control system was introduced. ""The practice was permanently discontinued in March 2015 and appropriate action taken to address further use of the call sign between February and March 2015.""

"This video can not be played Pearl Higgins died in winter 2020 after being admitted to hospital A woman has described the ""painful experience"" of losing three relatives who contracted Covid-19 in hospital. Miranda Evans said being unable to be with her grandmother while she was in hospital left her family traumatised. Some restrictions in hospitals had ""many adverse effects"" on patients' physical and mental health, a new report into the management of Covid-19 in hospitals in Wales has found. The Welsh government said the findings would help improve services. The interim report was produced by the National Nosocomial Covid-19 Programme, which was established by the Welsh government in April 2020.  Its aim is to support health organisations to investigate the safety implications of the high number of hospital-acquired Covid infections during the pandemic. The report highlights ""early lessons"" following an assessment by NHS Wales of more than 5,000 ""patient safety incidents"", which occurred between March 2020 and April 2022. Patient safety incidents are cases where one or more patients could have come to harm after catching Covid in healthcare settings. Miranda Evans, 44, from Bridgend, lost her grandmother, uncle and aunt to Covid-19, all of whom contracted the virus in hospital.  Ms Evans' grandmother, Pearl Higgins, 92, was admitted to hospital with a stroke in September 2020. Due to visiting restrictions, Ms Evans and her mother were unable to visit her. ""She was taken into hospital and we never saw her again. We were unable to see my grandmother. We were unable to speak to her,"" she revealed. ""There was very few people on hand to take calls for families. It was an extremely painful experience."" Ms Higgins was moved to four different wards, which made her family anxious about the prospect of her contracting Covid.  A few months into her stay, Ms Higgins tested positive for Covid and was moved to the Covid ward immediately. After a few days in the ward, she passed away. Ms Evans and her family were unable to say their last goodbyes.  ""No-one found us to say she was dying. We found out after she had died. It was extremely traumatising. We were all beside ourselves. ""A bomb went off in our family. Our hearts were just aching. We all felt numb.  ""We had nightmares for months afterwards. My mum still has nightmares now. She dreams that my nan is lost in the hospital somewhere."" Ms Evans said she believed her grandmother may have survived if she had been able to see her family. ""She just needed a familiar face. She needed someone, just one relative, and that could have been my mother who had been shielding with her for three months solidly."" She added: ""Definitely valuable lessons to be learnt from this and for future pandemics, future emergencies, future diseases. So, we need to make sure that we're emergency planning now, you know, to make sure that we're catering for the needs of disabled people in their families."" NHS visiting restrictions were introduced on several occasions to try to limit Covid transmission into hospital and protect vulnerable patients.  But the report says these restrictions had ""many adverse effects on the physical and mental health of patients, especially those in vulnerable groups that the restrictions were intended to safeguard - who were not able to fully understand the decisions made"". ""The limited alternative opportunities for making contact and communicating with loved ones, also negatively impacted the experience of other service users, families and carers,"" it says. The report recommends all services and wards should have dedicated patients support teams to help families and carers having difficulty visiting loved ones. The report makes it clear that the ""scale of the pandemic"" meant hospital patients ""inevitably faced an increased risk"", especially at times when the virus was spreading widely in communities. The lack of testing capacity was a key problem during the early stages, it says. ""Demand exceeding capacity and the inability to test rapidly for Covid-19... meant that testing was somewhat ineffective as a mechanism for reducing infections, until the supply of consumables met demand and testing capacity increase,"" according to the report. It also said infections could have spread more easily because patients had to be moved around cramped and, in some cases, outdated hospital buildings, hindering the hospitals' ability to isolate people. The report recommends patients are seen ""in the right place, at the right time"", with any reasons for moving patients communicated quickly to their families. ""Do not attempt cardio-pulmonary resuscitation"" (DNACPR) decisions are designed to protect people from unnecessary suffering caused by receiving resuscitation they do not want, will not work or where the harms outweigh the benefits. But concerns emerged during the pandemic there was ""a blanket approach"" to their use along with a lack consultation with families. The report says ""the analysis did not identify evidence where DNACPR was used inappropriately"" or not in keeping with Wales-wide policy. However, it calls for better communication around ""this sensitive subject"", stressing families and carers need to be involved in the process as much as possible. It says the roll-out of an electronic advanced care planning document would be a key improvement and alleviate potential issues. The report identifies a number of further ""early lessons"", including the need for: The National Nosocomial Covid-19 Programme will continue to work with Welsh health organisations to identify further lessons, with a final report scheduled for spring 2024. So far the programme has looked at 5,000 of the ""most complex"" patient safety incidents where Covid was spread in hospitals. There are 18,000 cases in total to be assessed. The interim report acknowledges that while its contents ""may be upsetting for many... it is imperative that [it]... offers transparent insights that will lead to meaningful change"". However, it says the work does not ""seek to detract"" from the role of the UK Covid-19 Inquiry, which will likely hear evidence about the pandemic response in Wales along with the rest of the UK later this year. Deputy Chief Medical Officer for Wales Chris Jones said: ""The National Nosocomial Covid-19 Programme and Welsh government extend sincere condolences to those who lost loved ones after acquiring Covid-19 in healthcare settings.

"A third inspection in a year failed to find any major improvements at a north Wales hospital's emergency department. Staff at Glan Clwyd Hospital's A&E were said to be working tirelessly to give the best care possible, but the service still requires significant improvement. Inspectors said poor sepsis screening and triage and pain relief delays were putting patients at significant risk. Health Minister Eluned Morgan admitted there were still ""very, very serious problems"" at the department. Betsi Cadwaladr health board said progress needed to ""accelerate"". Inspectors' concerns about standards in the department were classified as the most significant, with minimal improvements since their two previous visits. The report comes a month after the health board was placed back in special measures following a damning audit report, and 11 independent board members were told to quit by the Welsh government. Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) visited the emergency department of the hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire, in November after previous visits in March and May of 2022. Their report again highlights an ""incredibly busy department, struggling with shortages of staff, high numbers of seriously unwell patients and a lack of space to treat them"". The same could be said of emergency departments across Wales, but the fact that so little has been done to improve things since two previous visits means it remains under HIW's highest level of scrutiny. HIW chief executive Alun Jones said: ""This inspection found evidence of a department struggling to cope with the day-to-day demand of providing a safe service to patients. ""It has highlighted areas such as poor team working between the ED [emergency department] and other departments within the hospital which, in turn, is compounding nationally recognised challenges around patient flow.  ""The health board will need to take strong and decisive action to tackle the issues identified in our inspection. We will continue to engage with the health board to ensure sustained action is taken in relation to our findings. ""Inspectors found the standard of patient notes had improved, however rotas were challenging as there was a heavy reliance on bank and agency staff because of recruitment and retention issues. ""While waiting times to see a doctor had improved since May, the flow of patients through the department was still extremely challenging. ""Waits to see a specialty doctor varied and inspectors found on some occasions those doctors refused to review patients waiting in the ED, leading to further delays."" HIW said it would continue to monitor the response of the health board very closely. The health board has apologised to patients who may not have received ""the level of care they deserved"". Dr Nick Lyons, executive medical director and interim deputy chief executive of Betsi Cadwaladr health board, noted improvements highlighted by inspectors but acknowledged ""we still have some way to go"" to improve care for all patients."" ""It is true staff within the ED at Glan Clwyd Hospital have been under enormous strain for the past three years and this has increased since restrictions eased,"" he said. ""Attempts to attract permanent members of staff to support the ED's work continues and another recruitment open day is planned within the next few weeks. ""However, the fragility in staffing and the volume of acutely unwell people we receive each day means we remain a service requiring significant improvement. ""The vast majority of our colleagues are a credit to our organisation and we value their hard work and professionalism. We will continue to strive to make sure they feel supported by colleagues in other specialties and their hospital management teams."" Dr Lyons said he noted ""with pride"" inspectors' comments about the commitment of staff, and the satisfaction of the ""majority of patients"" with their care. He added: ""Despite the issues raised in the report inspectors acknowledged progress has been made but we know this needs to accelerate. ""Our colleagues within ED, and in other areas of the hospital, are fully focused on driving this change forward and we are pleased to see the proportion of patients moving through the department within four hours continuing to rise."" Following publication of the inspection report, Health Minister Eluned Morgan agreed there were ""still very, very serious problems"" at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd and its emergency department ""in particular"". Answering questions in the Welsh Parliament, the minister said there had been ""serious discussions"" with Dr Lyons ""to ask about what exactly has been put in place"" to improve the situation. ""There seems to be a specific problem here with the emergency department in Ysbyty Glan Clwyd,"" she said. ""We've got to encourage"" the department to learn from the other emergency departments within Betsi Cadwaladr health board that are ""working better"", the minister said. There had been ""some encouraging improvements after the previous inspection"" but it was ""very disappointing that many of the issues have still not been fully resolved"". Ms Morgan was answering questions from members including Vale of Clwyd Conservative MS Gareth Davies, who later urged Ms Morgan to ""get a grip on the situation"" and ""stop passing the buck"".  ""Patients, along with the people of North Wales, deserve better,"" he added.

"Trying to find a place to rent in today's market and beating your competitors to the front door can feel like a relentless race that you'll never win.  Property website Zoopla says the number of available properties to rent is down by a third since before the pandemic. So with such ferocious demand, what can you do to secure your new home?  Most people know the importance of having a decent credit rating and their deposit secured.  But how do you avoid the bidding wars and massive queues on ""open home"" day and get a landlord to pick you and not someone else?  If you're new to the rental race, we've asked agents and landlords to tell us impressed them most and made those hunting for a rental stand out from the crowd.   Rightmove said at the beginning of 2023, 70% of rental listings received an email enquiry from a potential tenant looking to view a property within the first day of it being listed on the website.  Its property expert Tim Bannister said: ""Tenants need to do their homework and decide what they really want from a home so they can be targeted - online, with agents, friends and family.  ""Then when instant alerts come through they can move quickly and get to the front of the queue. Be focussed and be prepared. Being first won't necessarily guarantee you the property but it will help."" Campaign group Generation Rent agreed. Spokesman Dan Wilson Craw said it was essential to know what the property needs to have, such as storage for a bike or a washing machine already installed.  ""That way if you view a property that ticks all the right boxes you can apply for a tenancy on the spot,"" he said.   Being loaded with information really helps landlords and agents when looking to choose a tenant.  Rightmove's Tim Bannister said: ""That means making sure you've got as much information as possible, for example multiple references with contacts available.  ""Be clear about your circumstances and how flexible you can be with your timelines. Be upfront and provide clarity. The more you can do to work with a landlord, the better."" Generation Rent said aside from having the holding deposit worth one week's rent in your account, prospective tenants needed to provide evidence of their income. That includes letting your employer and current landlord know they'll need to provide a reference.  If you have exhausted your time trying to find a rental in your perfect area try thinking outside the box. Zoopla said a travel time search can bring more properties into your orbit which you might not have considered.  Geographically, a home may look too far away but its travel time might be quicker than you thought. This can can open up your search to cheaper areas or slower rental markets.  Mr Bannister said rental searches on Rightmove had expanded since the pandemic with many approaching reaching 50km2 (19.3m2).

"Rents are rising at their fastest rate since records began in 2016. But with a quarter of tenants struggling to pay, what are your rights? Most tenants have a rental agreement called an assured shorthold tenancy. Some of these are rolling - which means tenants pay rent weekly or monthly, with no fixed end date. In England, the landlord: Any rent rise must be fair and realistic, in line with local properties. Other renters have a fixed agreement, which typically runs for six or 12 months. The landlord: If the fixed term is a year, landlords must give six months' notice. There are some other tenancy agreements with different rules. The housing charity Shelter's online tool can help people in England find out what kind of tenancy they have. Housing law and renting rules are different in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This video can not be played What can you do about rent increases? Watch the BBC's Lora Jones tell you, in a minute. In England a holding deposit is paid to a landlord to reserve a property. It can't be more than one week's rent. You should get the money back within seven days of signing your tenancy agreement - or it can go towards your rent. But if you decide not to move in, you could lose it.  If the landlord doesn't give it back, and you think they should, write to them. If you still don't get a refund, contact one of the letting agents redress schemes. You can also complain in England to Trading Standards through the Citizen's Advice consumer helpline. Such deposits are not legal in Scotland, and rules are different in Wales and Northern Ireland. Landlords need to follow strict rules if they want a tenant to leave - if not, the eviction could be illegal, or the landlord could be guilty of harassment. In England the landlord has to give written notice to the tenant, which could be:  Other tenancy contracts have different rules. Once the notice period ends, the landlord can start eviction proceedings through court. Landlords can apply for a so-called ""possession order"". If that is granted and you don't leave, landlords can apply for a ""warrant for possession"". Rules differ in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Tenants in England have the right to ""live in a property that's safe and in a good state of repair"". Similar rules are in place in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Landlords are not expected to do small jobs like changing light bulbs. However, a rented home could be unfit if, for example, the electrics are unsafe, it's damp, or there's a problem with rats or mice. If so, you can complain to your landlord, or - if that doesn't work - your local council. Your landlord may try to evict you rather than make repairs, but you might have more protection if you've already complained to the council.  Tenants need to pay rent on time, cover the bills they are responsible for, and look after the property. This includes disposing of rubbish, and keeping the property reasonably clean. It could be discrimination under equality law in England if a landlord refuses to rent a property to a woman because she has children. Before you complain, you need to be able to show you can afford the rent, and that the property is a suitable size, Shelter says. Landlords should not issue blanket bans on pets, and must give a good reason to refuse them - for example, the property is too small. However, they can charge a higher rent to cover the risk of pet damage. Landlords can choose to include bills such as council tax, but don't have to. If a landlord includes utility bills, they cannot charge more than they are paying.

"When the rent on her east London flat rose by £350 a month, BBC journalist Lorna Acquah decided to look elsewhere. Her search to find a new one was filled with long queues, bidding wars and greasy kitchens.  For the past two months, I've been living in rental hell. My mornings begin with a new daily ritual - logging onto property websites to check the listings and dashing off as many messages I can. During the day, I race around the city to attend viewings. At night, I dream of magnolia walls and white metro tiles.  My partner and I hadn't planned to move, but the tenancy on our flat - a one-bed shoebox in Dalston, east London  - came up for renewal. The landlord wouldn't budge - he wanted £1,650 a month, a 27% increase. We could just about afford it, but after a leak flooded the bedroom we opted to try for something cheaper elsewhere.  So far, I've seen 20 flats all over the city - and I still don't have a contract to show for it.  My first viewing was a £1,200 a month one-bed on the busy Holloway Road in north London. The flat was above a café and outside, rubbish bags and abandoned cups littered the pavement. A queue of exhausted renters had formed by the doorway. Most were in their late 20s and early 30s, but others were well into their 40s.  Inside, we avoided eye contact while fighting for space to take pictures. The bathroom stank of damp, with stained yellow tiles and sprawling patches of black mould. In the living area, we tiptoed around the existing tenant who continued his work call about computer code. Best offers were needed by 3pm that day, but I didn't make one.  Next on my list was a £1,080 a month studio in Haringey, a zone three area in the north-east of the city. Here, the microwave was on the floor beside the sink with the bathroom door inches from the the bed. To save even more space, the landlord hadn't bothered to install a washing machine. I left quickly.  Fed up, we widened our search area and raised our budget to £1,600 per month. And we're not alone - spending more on rent is a national trend. The cost of living crisis, rising interest rates and an increase in the number of people returning to cities after the pandemic are pushing prices up all over the country.  Rents have risen 4.4% across the UK in the past year, according to the ONS. Analysis by Zoopla, one of the UK's largest online property portals, suggests rents have increased by 11.5% for tenants entering new leases.  After being outbid on flats I wouldn't have considered a year ago, the whole process started to feel like another full-time job. One agent asked me to submit a personal statement and a link to my LinkedIn profile. Some would-be-renters said they were spending 40 hours a week searching or had sneaked out of work to attend viewings.  In areas close to central London, I heard from people who had been asked to pay six months' rent upfront or sign three-year leases. Some tenants were spending more than 30% of their income on rent, an amount the ONS says is unaffordable. But things were crazy further out too. In a grease-stained kitchen in zone five south-east London, an agent told me I'd need to make a swift offer or the flat would be let.  Another reason for the chaos is a supply and demand issue. Some landlords are selling their properties to free up cash, reduce costs or avoid new regulations, says Zoopla's executive director Richard Donnell. Investment in new rental homes has stalled over the past six years, he says. A typical estate agent now has just eight available homes to rent, half the pre-pandemic average.   I hopped on a train to see what the situation is like in other parts of the country. The East Midlands has seen some of highest rises in the UK - rents there have gone up 5% in the past year.  After calling 20 listings, I secured just three viewings in central Nottingham. All were in decent condition and required offers by the end of the day. The estate agents said most of their lettings are to NHS staff or working professional couples. This keeps renters like Claire Fitzpatrick and her son Alistair from making a successful bid. Claire's disabilities means she's unable to work and is on benefits. She's on the social housing list, but that will take years. In the meantime, she's forced to battle it out on the private market, losing out to people like me. ""I'm priced out in Nottingham; you just can't get anywhere, it's just awful,"" she told me. ""If you've got a couple, or a teacher in front of you and they're earning 30, 40, 50 grand a year, they're not going to pick me.""  Mould, leaks and electrical hazards were a constant issue in the family's previous two-bedroom rental. But in October, the rent went up by £75, a 12% increase. Sharp rental rises are legal, though guidelines recommend increases should be be in line with market rates for the area. For now, Claire and Alistair are staying with relatives.  Dan Wilson-Craw, deputy director of Generation Rent, has heard many stories like Claire's. He's calling for a rent freeze until the cost of living crisis eases, but says rent controls - a limit on the amount a landlord can charge for rent - should be part of the long-term solution to help renters. It's an approach taken in countries like Germany, but others, like Zoopla's Richard Donnell, say controls can discourage investment and lead to more landlords leaving the market.  Both say the solution lies in building more homes and allocating a greater proportion of them to low-income households. Dan Wilson-Craw says the Renters' Reform Bill, which is due to be published this year, could give renters more security and greater powers to negotiate on rent.  In the meantime, I'm stuck. With interest rates so high, buying a place of our own seems an ever more distant prospect.  A couple of weeks ago, we moved back in with our families as our tenancy ended. I know I'm lucky to have this option, as others don't, but when I look at my lilac bedroom walls I feel like I've regressed to my teenage self.  After a short break, I'll be back to the rental rat race - hoping I can soon put this frustrating situation to an end.  Illustrations by Jenny Law. Additional reporting by Yazmina García-Fernández.

"Even for comedians, the cost of living crisis is no laughing matter.  Soaring travel costs, unaffordable accommodation, stagnant fees and cash-strapped audiences have made it harder than ever to make a living on stage, BBC Scotland has been told. And with inflation unexpectedly rising to a 45-year high of 10.4% in February, the outlook is even bleaker.  As performers gathered for the Glasgow International Comedy Festival, they spoke about how the industry was faring.  Edinburgh-based comedian Liam Withnail said hotel prices had ""gone absolutely insane"" since the pandemic, while return tickets to perform at gigs in England can cost about £200. He told BBC Scotland he was turning down shows in Manchester and London because the costs were too high - and because performance fees had remained flat for years. ""It's got to the point where I'm financially better off not working than I am some nights,"" the stand-up said. Withnail, who has been a professional comedian for 10 years, added: ""It's tough and it's tougher now than ever.""  He echoed fears, aired earlier this year by Richard Herring, that the profession is becoming increasingly closed off to people from less privileged backgrounds. Withnail predicted that the long-term effect would be ""devastating"" for the industry, with the ""overwhelming majority"" of performers he knows deciding to stay away from this year's Edinburgh Fringe due to the expense. ""The Edinburgh Fringe will slowly lose everything that's good about it and become a playground for the children of millionaires,"" the comedian warned.  Yet with the gloom comes a desire to escape it, Withnail said. ""People need a laugh and they want to come out and it's a good way to socialise and to either forget or see the world in a new and funny light,"" he added. Amy Matthews, has also had to turn down gigs in England due to the cost of rail travel from Scotland.  ""It just means that line-ups will become less interesting, less diverse if they can only draw on the talent that's on someone's doorstep,"" she said. Matthews warned that barriers were being put up to people from less privileged backgrounds. ""That has historically always been the case, but it's obviously been brought into stark relief in the cost of living crisis,"" she said. Venues, too, are struggling to make ends meet as Scots are forced to reign in their spending. Analysis of YouGov polling by Citizens Advice Scotland (CAS), published in January, suggested nearly half (48%) of Scots had cut back on household spending due to energy costs. Two in three (66%) of those who have reduced spending have cut back on eating or drinking out, CAS said. One comedy venue that has been praised for helping comedians amid the cost of living crisis is the Monkey Barrel in Edinburgh, which has put on extra shows since reopening during the pandemic.  ""I think there's no other comedy club in Scotland doing what we do - it's putting a lot of money into people's pockets,"" director David Bleese said. His club puts on up to six shows a night, with audiences of up to 155 people. Tickets range from £5 to £15 at weekends, as well as pay-what-you-like performances.  Bleese said the club had also adapted to modern demands, setting up its own podcast studio and broadcasting more shows online. However, he added: ""What we can't really keep up with is the cost of accommodation and the cost of travel. ""People are making the choice not to come up to Edinburgh outside of August - well, people are making the decision not to come to Edinburgh in August."" Glaswegian comedian Lubna Kerr, who also works one day a week with the NHS, said she would not able to survive financially without her second job.  Kerr, whose latest show is a one-woman play in Scots-English and Urdu about two Scottish-Pakistani women, explained that getting well-paid work in an industry which had traditionally been dominated by white men was ""not easy"".  ""Especially when you're an older Pakistani women,"" she said. Kerr told BBC Scotland it was ""not enough to make people laugh"" amid the cost of living crisis, ""because being a comedian is a business and you are the business, you're the product, you need to market yourself"". She added: ""Scotland's got such a rich history of comedians and it would be a shame if it was only the rich that were able to do it. But I think where there's a will there's a way."" Jim Smith combines his comedy career with running a farm in Perthshire. He spoke to BBC Scotland as he juggled lambing season with a comedy tour.  Tickets selling well has been a ""lifesaver,"" he said as fuel, food, travel and accommodation costs ""go mental"".  Smith has worked with the RSABI, a charity which provides practical and emotional support to people living in rural Scotland. He has seen how financial pressure can affect the mental health of farmers. The comedian has seen some similarities in stand-up. ""Comedians you expect in the green room to be happy, jolly people but they can be quite serious and quiet.  ""Then they go on stage and flick a switch and that's their act,"" he said. ""It can be a lonely experience.""  Such issues have only been ""compounded"" by fears about the cost of living, Smith added. The stand-up also warned it would be a ""tragedy"" if comedy became closed off to people from all backgrounds due to costs.  But he added: ""All you need to own in life is a pen and paper and a good imagination to get a start.  ""Funny's funny and the cream always rises. If you're funny, consistently funny, you will make it to the top.""

"Paul O'Grady's death has prompted a flood of tributes from celebrities across the entertainment industry and even the Royal Family. And the legacy of his witty blonde alter ego Lily Savage has been described by the drag community as trailblazing and life-changing.  The character, inspired by tough but colourful women in his family, had fans spanning generations - with many saying her rise to fame led the way for thousands of future drag artists.  Copper Topp, a contestant on the latest series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK, says waking up to the news they ""had such a heavy heart"".  ""It was through Paul O'Grady and Lily Savage that British drag culture was born,"" she said. ""They've paved the way for legions of drag artists and I wouldn't be here without them."" The 39-year-old said of watching Lily on TV in the 90s: ""I was in awe of her… at the time I had no idea who I was and what I wanted to be... but she made me feel comfortable for the first time."" Referencing O'Grady's work in the fight against Aids and HIV, Copper Topp said: ""It must have been such a hard time to live with that going on.  ""From the police raids in the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, to then becoming a prime time TV household name - she was a face for a whole generation of queer people and she still is."" The performer, who uses she/her pronouns when in drag, said O'Grady's ""quick wit and dry sense of humour"" as Lily on mainstream television ""changed the game"" for drag artists.  ""Paul and Lily have been a voice for a queer generation,"" they said, adding: ""She walked so we could run."" Danny Beard, who won RuPaul's Drag Race UK Series 4, says they remember watching O'Grady as a child.  ""It was hilarious and as a young gay boy to sit there and see something of yourself on television, it meant things were OK and it meant I could dream to do that as well."" Describing O'Grady as a ""trailblazer"", they told BBC News: ""He took drag to the mainstream and really set the way for people like me to be able to do our jobs."" Beard said O'Grady was an ""icon"" for queens, people from Merseyside and many working-class people.  ""For Paul to make it mainstream on television just after the Aids crisis and working through it as an entertainer really was a testament to who he was as a person,"" they said. Beard said drag was changing around the world, and looking at the legacy of O'Grady ""it's nice to be reminded that drag isn't new"".  ""Drag isn't scary and it's been around for a long time and we ain't going anywhere, baby!,"" they said, adding: ""He's an icon and he's an inspiration to so many queer people that want to make it in the entertainment industry."" Gareth Joyner, who works as Myra DuBois, says having Lily Savage on mainstream media ""demystified drag for a lot of people"". She [Lily] ""created visibility for drag artists"", he said, adding: ""It gave queer people and drag performers the confidence that it might be possible."" Talking of their inspiration, Joyner said Lily Savage was ""certainly on the mood board"" and taught him that drag does not have to be nice.  Her character with ripped fish-nets and a scowl ""appealed to me more as a creative"", said Joyner.   The drag performer said: ""I owe him [O'Grady] a tremendous debt of gratitude that he was on television when I was a little kid because I could see those glimmers of representation. ""I don't know who I'd be if that didn't exist.""  There have been even more tributes on social media. Comedian Jayde Adams, who started her career as an Adele drag act, posted a picture of O'Grady as Lily on Twitter and said: ""She's the reason drag even exists in the UK."" Cheddar Gorgeous, who was the runner-up on Drag Race UK's fourth series, said: ""We love you Lily, you will forever walk the alleyways of our hearts."" ""A British institution, beamed into households every week for decades, celebrated for her sharp wit, filthy tongue and innuendo and equally for his heart of gold and warmth in panto and family entertainment"", the drag artist posted on Instagram.

"""I think people need to realise that gaming is not just sitting at your desk all day."" Kelsie Grieg, or Kels as she's known in the gaming world, made history when she became the first woman to qualify for the Call of Duty Challengers Elite tournament. But her journey to being a history maker has been far from smooth and simple. The 22-year-old from Scotland only got into gaming ""by accident"", after an injury put an end to her aspiring football career. ""I ended up meeting people who are currently in esports, professional gamers. And then I was introduced to the big world of esports,"" she tells BBC Newsbeat. ""I didn't realise how easy it was to meet people. And I wasn't too bad at it, so it made a difference."" But being in a male-dominated environment meant Kels wasn't accepted straightaway, with doubts from other men over how good a female player could be. ""People do tend to see gender as an issue, or at least did back then,"" she says. ""So that was quite a struggle. I had to prove myself and it took me a long time to prove myself.""  ""There's a lot of discrimination and you do have to be thick skinned."" This video can not be played Esports: Why are there so few professional women gamers? According to esportearnings.com, there are no female players in the top 400 earners and only a tiny fraction of the millions being won in competitions around the world is going to women. And it took a while for Kels to realise the significance of her qualification for the Challengers Elite. ""I didn't see it as making history, until I woke up [the next day],"" she says. ""And I was like wait a minute a female just qualified for the Elite and that female was me. ""It was incredible. But the main thing I've taken from it is if I can do it, hopefully other females can. ""I might be the first female to do it but hopefully I'm not the last. And it just means the world."" The esports market is estimated to grow to be worth $1.9bn (£1.4bn) by 2025. Hundreds of millions of people play and watch worldwide, with plenty of big brands involved in partnerships, and it was also showcased at the Commonwealth Games.  ""Going to events, travelling, playing for money. Just even getting this from gaming is incredible,"" Kels says. ""If you're not into gaming, I don't think you realise how big it is and how much you could do with it."" When it comes to making a career out of esports, Kels says there was a big split between receiving support and being told to ""get a real job"". ""My family are supportive with what I do but it's just like don't put all your eggs in one basket, which I can understand,"" she says. ""Especially back then, gaming was [seen as] just a hobby.

"The funeral of Betty Boothroyd, the first female Speaker of the House of Commons, has taken place. West Yorkshire-born Baroness Boothroyd, who served as Speaker from 1992 to 2000, died in February aged 93. She was the Labour MP for West Bromwich West from 1973 to 2000 and became a baroness in the House of Lords in 2001. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and current speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle were among those at the service in Cambridgeshire. ""Today we come together from across the political spectrum to remember one of our greatest Speakers - the remarkable Betty Boothroyd,"" the Prime Minister tweeted.  ""Parliament stands taller because of her service."" Sir Keir called Baroness Boothroyd an ""inspiration"".  ""A devoted public servant, Betty was at the forefront of a generation of women who smashed the glass ceiling for female politicians,"" he tweeted.  ""She will be dearly missed by all in politics."" The service was held at the 12th Century St George's Church in Thriplow, the village where she lived in her later years. Four pallbearers carried Baroness Boothroyd's coffin, adorned with a white floral tribute, into the stone church as organ music played. The service concluded with the congregation singing The Battle Hymn Of The Republic. Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab and Deputy Labour Leader Angela Rayner stood in for Mr Sunak and Sir Keir respectively during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons. Speaking after the service, Sir Lindsay described Baroness Boothroyd as one of the ""greatest women"" he had ever known and said he will always be ""in awe"". ""She supported me to become Speaker and she always gave me advice, whether I wanted it or not, Betty would ring up and just put me right,"" he said. ""She smashed that glass ceiling to smithereens, she became the first and only woman speaker we've ever had. ""Didn't she climb some hills, from Yorkshire to the hills of Westminster, she took every challenge in her stride and didn't she know how to do it."" The Reverend Angela Melaniphy, who led the service, said Baroness Boothroyd had planned the service and ""chosen all the music"". ""The entry music was Climb Ev'ry Mountain sung by Dame Patricia Routledge, who was a very close friend of Baroness Betty Boothroyd's,"" she said. ""What was lovely about it was that her family was there, her very close friends were there, members of the village were there and members of Parliament were there - it was a service that included all of her life and each part of that reflected how highly she was regarded."" Betty Boothroyd was born on 8 October 1929 in Dewsbury and was the only daughter of mill workers. Growing up in a political environment - her father was a trade unionist - she described herself as coming ""out of the womb into the Labour movement"". Baroness Boothroyd was a professional dancer from 1946 to 1948 and appeared in pantomime in London's West End before going into politics. She then took a number of office jobs, working for the Labour MP Barbara Castle and on the campaign to elect John F. Kennedy as US President. This video can not be played Watch: Time's up! Betty Boothroyd's farewell to the Commons In May 1973, after several attempts, she entered Parliament, securing the seat of West Bromwich, later renamed West Bromwich West.

"Humza Yousaf has made history as the first Muslim to lead a country in western Europe. As the new leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), he's taken over from Nicola Sturgeon as the country's first minister. It makes him the first ethnic minority leader of a devolved government and the first Muslim to lead a major UK party. BBC Newsbeat went to one of Scotland's most diverse areas to see what people there think about the new leader. From the halal bakery to the Asian jewellers and colourful clothes shops, the Pollokshields area of Glasgow is full of South Asian influences. Humza says he's keen to support communities like this one, which is in his constituency and also faces problems with deprivation and poverty. So do people living in the area think having a leader from a South Asian background will help them? Ismail Ahmed, who we spoke to on Albert Drive - billed as one of the most diverse streets in Scotland - thinks so. ""As a South Asian myself I think it's a pretty good thing our community is being represented,"" the 20-year-old says. ""I feel like Pakistanis, or even just South Asians in general, don't really have a big representation. ""And now that the first minister, the person that's controlling the country, is a South Asian, it just shows that there'll be more representation."" Humza was widely seen as being the preferred candidate of the SNP establishment - including Nicola Sturgeon herself. ""I'm Pakistani South Asian. So I feel like he's more relatable than Nicola Sturgeon was,"" Ismail tells Newsbeat. ""I feel like she was doing a pretty good job. So if he's able to continue and maintain what she was doing, I think that's good enough."" Nadia Anwar owns a clothes shop on the street and thinks Humza being the new leader could be massive for giving the community the confidence to speak up. ""There's a lot of things that need to get done. I feel the Asian community will be more forward speaking to somebody that is of ethnic minority, because sometimes our voice doesn't really get heard,"" she says. ""There's some people that are from Pakistan, from India, from Bangladesh, and they don't have anybody to actually call up to and say 'look this is my problem'. ""Because he's from that same kind of cultural background I feel as though he'll be able to understand more. ""He might not necessarily be able to help them, but then it's a good way of the Asian community being involved in politics. ""Because that's another thing as well, there's not a lot of ethnic minority people within the political environment. And I feel that that will be a good thing."" Humza's dad is originally from Pakistan and emigrated to Scotland with his family in the 1960s, while his mother was born into a South Asian family in Kenya. He's often spoken of the racist abuse he has received and called the police after allegedly receiving threats at the start of the leadership contest.  Talha Moqsud, 31, hopes having a Muslim leader will help the community deal with racism and discrimination. ""I think it's very important for us as Muslims, it gives us a little bit more hope,"" he says. ""Just hopefully [he] could bring in more opportunities for us. And get rid of any kind of discrimination [and] racism that still kicks about."" Another person on Albert Drive was 18-year-old Zirva. She agrees with Nadia about their new leader being able to represent their community at the top table of Scottish politics. ""It's definitely good to have representation,"" she says.  ""Obviously in the Western world, it's hard to see somebody that looks like you and has the same kind of beliefs to make up there so it's quite good."" So now he's officially the new leader, can Humza deal with all of the issues in Scotland at the moment? ""I'll be honest with you, I don't know,"" Nadia says. ""I hope he does well, I'll have every faith in him but we'll see."" Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube. Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

"In the original Mary Poppins film, the nine year old Michael Banks accidentally starts a bank run by demanding back his tuppence coin.  The dynamics had barely evolved when in 2007, Northern Rock saw runs outside its branches, heralding the start of the 2007-08 global financial crisis.  A year on, when Bradford & Bingley ran into trouble, the Bank of England had spotters outside the bank's branches but were relieved to see no such queues for the nation's TV cameras. But the dynamics of bank runs appear to be evolving - and heading off such panics may be getting harder.  I have often pondered the following question: what would the 2007-08 financial crisis have been like in the current era of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok? That question may now be being inadvertently and not wholly positively answered by the current banking jitters.  Silicon Valley Bank saw the fastest bank run in US history according to the head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell. His vice chair Michael Barr told the US Senate yesterday that ""social media saw a surge in talk about a run, and uninsured depositors acted quickly to flee"", pulling their funds ""at an extraordinary rate of $40bn (£32bn)in one day"".  On the following day SVB anticipated ""even greater outflows"" and so ""panic prevailed among SVB's remaining depositors"". These are utterly staggering sums. The contagion was cross-continental. The Bank of England told MPs on Monday that SVB UK, its British arm, had lost £3bn, or 30%, of its deposit base on the same day. Governor Andrew Bailey earlier this week said: ""One of the lessons that we have to take from Silicon Valley Bank, and it's not the only example, is in an age of social media, the speed at which runs can take place. And in an age of digital banking, the speed at which social media can be translated into loss. This is very different from the Northern Rock-style queue at the branch"". He pointed to looking at changing the regulations on bank safety to see if they ""match to that sort of dynamic that's taking place"". The dynamic is a combination of instant internet banking and social media, meaning that a system built on credibility, faith, and trust are now inherently more fragile. Think about the leading lights in tech on WhatsApp groups or Slack, advising the companies they are invested in to withdraw all their cash.  ""Bank run"" doesn't quite capture it. SVB was more of an 100 metre world record Olympic bank sprint.  And while SVB had its own special dynamic, with depositors concentrated in one industry, and with most deposits not covered by normal saver protections, these concerns do apply more widely. A search of ""bank run"" on key social media over the past two weeks revealed a wide range of figures advising people to withdraw their cash from similar institutions.  Some of this was wrapped up into distrust of mainstream ""experts"" versus trust in cryptocurrency. Part of the success of Bitcoin, and crypto in general, has been evangelical scepticism of normal banking. This is now a vocal and noticeable online community, which was not present during the 2008 financial crisis. All of this has not been helped by communications difficulties over what is and is not covered by US deposit guarantees. The bottom line is that it is reasonable to conclude that a low trust environment bred on social media has a material impact on the fragility of a system built on faith. That in turn might require a regulatory response.  The head of the Bank of England's regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority's Sam Woods, told MPs yesterday that it might have to change its assumption about how quickly deposits can flee a bank.  At the moment what is known as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio assumes that a bank might only lose 0-20% of its retail deposits or 20-40% of its corporate deposits over a period of one month.  A reminder: SVB UK lost 30% of its deposits in a single day. The current regulation seems likely to be changed, but the flip side of that will mean that banks might not be able to lend as much into the economy.  Perhaps this is an overreaction to the very special case of SVB. It is a careful balancing act. Other jurisdictions are also pondering whether to increase the amount of deposits covered under protection schemes. It is a fair criticism, however, that it is unrealistic to imagine businesses can bank, and run payrolls, from dozens of bank accounts, designed to protect all their deposit balances. The good news is that the UK regulatory system has performed well so far. SVB UK was obliged to turn into a subsidiary last year, and that meant it had the assets to be sold on intact to HSBC, without taxpayer funding.  But the way we calculate the safety of banks may change quickly as a result of this month's ""Insta-run"".

"The brother of TV host Phillip Schofield told the presenter about engaging in sexual activity with a teenager, a court has heard. Timothy Schofield, 54, is on trial at Exeter Crown Court accused of 11 sexual offences against a child, including two of sexual activity with a child.     The civilian police worker, from Bath, is said to have committed the offences around Bristol between 2016 and 2019.  He allegedly told his brother about the offending in September 2021.  In a written statement read to the court on Wednesday, the This Morning presenter said he had invited his brother to visit him in London after receiving a call from him in an ""agitated and upset state"".  Mr Schofield said they had a meal and spent several hours talking before his brother raised the issue of sexual activity with the complainant. He said the defendant was ""in an extreme state of agitation"" and ""as angry as I have ever seen him"".  Timothy Schofield expressed suicidal thoughts but rejected the presenter's suggestions that he see his GP. ""Tim said he didn't want to take pills. At some point in the conversation Tim told me he was also impotent, and I responded that there were pills for that, too,"" Mr Schofield said.  The presenter continued: ""I was washing up and Tim was standing behind me and he said, 'You are going to hate me for what I am about to say'. ""I said there was nothing he could say that would make me hate him."" Timothy Schofield then told his older brother about watching porn with the teen and performing sexual acts.  Mr Schofield's statement continued: ""I turned and said, 'What did you just say?' He said it was last year and we were alone together. ""Tim said it was just this once. I told him it should never happen again."" The presenter said his brother had then tried to give him more details about the incident.  ""I said, 'F***, stop'. I shouted at Tim that he had to stop. I didn't want to know any of the details but he made it sound like a one-off,"" Mr Schofield said.  ""I said, 'I don't want you to tell me anymore'. I said, 'You've got to stop, just never do it again. Regardless how that happened it must never happen again'."" The defendant, who is employed by Avon and Somerset Police as an IT technician, denies three charges of causing a child to watch sexual activity and three of sexual activity in the presence of a child. He further denies three charges of causing a child to engage in sexual activity and two of sexual activity with a child. The trial continues.  Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

"Humza Yousaf has taken over the job Nicola Sturgeon held for more than eight years. He's become the leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), and the country's first minister. For many people in their teens and 20s, it's the biggest political change in Scotland in their adult lives. BBC Newsbeat spent a week speaking to young people across the country to find out what they think about some of the big issues facing the new SNP leader. One of the things Nicola Sturgeon was best known for was her desire to make Scotland independent. That would mean breaking away from the rest of the UK, and giving the government more control over its own laws and political decisions. Catering student James was 10 years old in 2014, when Scotland held a referendum on becoming independent. In the end, 55% voted to remain inside the UK and 45% voted for independence. The 19-year-old says he remembers stickers - Yes or No - depending on which way people planned to vote. ""You still see them now,"" he says. ""Folks still have them on their cars and everything... mostly Yes."" Humza Yousaf's said he's pro-independence, but so far he's sounded more cautious than Nicola Sturgeon on the issue. But it isn't the topic on the minds of most young people Newsbeat speaks to. Melanie's view is straightforward: ""It doesn't interest me at all. ""They need to focus on the prices of stuff. The cost of living's going up far too much and people are struggling far too much."" One person who's definitely felt the cost-of-living crisis hitting her bank account is 21-year-old Jody, from Dundee. She's now based in Fort William, studying adventure education in the West Highlands and working in a soft play centre. One big cost Jody's cut down on is rent - she's swapped living in a flat for a 20-year-old Maxus van she now calls home. ""It's a bit raggedy and rusty, but inside it's lovely and has everything I need,"" she says. Jody says the van's fridge, small cooker and tiny heater have ""definitely helped me to live cheaper"".  ""The cost of petrol is the only thing I have to really worry about."" Jody she also has to contend with some brutal winter temperatures - something she says she only survived thanks to a sleeping bag onesie her mum bought for her. She says her experience has highlighted the need for a ""balance of what people have and what people need"". Even in Fort William, she says, there are ""too many people, not enough houses"" and rent costs are too high. ""A lot of people, even adults and older people are living in shared houses,"" she says.  ""That would be good to be sorted."" Humza Yousaf's made history as the first ethnic minority leader of a devolved government and the first Muslim to lead a major UK party. And young Scots in the diverse Pollokshields area of Glasgow hope his victory means he will give more of a voice to people from a South Asian background. ""As a South Asian myself I think it's a pretty good thing our community is being represented,"" the 20-year-old Ismail Ahmed says. ""I feel like Pakistanis, or even just South Asians in general, don't really have a big representation. ""And now that the first minister, the person that's controlling the country, is a South Asian, it just shows that there'll be more representation."" Nicola Sturgeon set ambitious climate targets for Scotland - but it's repeatedly missed them. If he wants to catch up that could mean unpopular decisions for Humza Yousaf.  Especially in places like Aberdeen - the ""oil capital of Europe"" - where many are employed in the off-shore rigs off the coast. Jimmy, who talks to Newsbeat while walking his dog along the coast, tells us his dad works off-shore which is not unusual for the area. ""Growing up in Aberdeen you always know somebody who works off-shore so it's certainly an industry that I would say affects everybody in the city and the north-east,"" he says. But he's not against changing the way things are done. ""If it's a managed transition I would move towards cleaner and greener energy, I think that's a good thing."" Cerys is a member of climate campaign Fridays for Future - a group that's welcomed Humza Yousaf's stance on phasing out fossil fuels in favour of renewables. She says ""oil and gas is something we have to transition away from as quickly as possible"". But Cerys acknowledges that it's ""incredibly important that oil workers and their families are supported"" in any move away from fossil fuels. Things are changing - a little further up the coast from Aberdeen you can see a huge wind farm and a new harbour dedicated to supporting green energy. But for campaigners like Cerys it's not enough. ""Aberdeen could be the renewable energy capital of Europe instead of the oil capital,"" she says. One issue that's dominated coverage of Scottish politics this year has been the row over trans rights. The Scottish parliament voted to make it easier for people to change their legal gender, but the UK government blocked the move. Humza Yousaf says he'll challenge the blocking of the bill in the courts, but only if legal advice supports this. The issue was put back in the spotlight this year when Isla Bryson, a transgender rapist, was jailed for attacking two women before changing gender. Andie, 27, who identifies as non-binary, spoke to Newsbeat in Lenzie, near Glasgow. ""It's kind of scary to be a trans person in Scotland and also the UK right now,"" Andie says. Andie thinks the backlash against the Gender Reform Bill has been a setback for LGBT people. ""It took me a long time to figure out who I was,"" says Andie. ""I think that's because I didn't have people in my life like me and people in Scotland didn't understand it."" Nicole, 25, from Edinburgh, is opposed to the changes to the gender laws and worries they'll make single-sex spaces like ""accommodation, sport and women's refuges"" less safe. This is one of the reasons critics, including high-profile opponents like JK Rowling, say the plans are an attack on women's rights. Nicole's not convinced by the argument that other countries have relaxed self-identification rules without an increase in attacks on women. ""A lot of the time it's difficult to track because you're recording by gender identity and not sex, then you can't trace the impact,"" she says. But Andie says the proposed changes don't put women's rights at risk. ""Those rights are still there, we're not asking to take them away, we're just asking for us to have rights too."" Perhaps the biggest challenge for Humza Yousaf will be getting young people to pay attention to politics at all. Lots of those who spoke to Newsbeat said they didn't bother with it. ""I don't really look at news,"" catering student James told us. ""I only look at it if something big happens."" And Jody, who lives in her van, said: ""I find the news quite depressing, quite anxiety-inducing so I try to stay away from it."" But there might be some hope. Remember those 16 and 17 year olds given a vote in 2014?  More than 100,000 of the 3.6 million who turned out to vote were in that age group. So maybe they can be convinced to come back again.

""I couldn't stop. It's a pleasure to be able to stop because of the problems you have in life,"" he says. ""You don't really have time to deal with your mental health at the time - you just have them quiet moments and outbursts where you just go crazy."" This video can not be played Joshua breaks down in his post-fight press conference after loss to Usyk Since then the British boxer has found a new trainer, booked the Franklin fight and been to a training camp in Texas. ""It was bumpy but I was hanging on and look where it's led me now - to the O2 Arena in London competing again."" AJ's been praised for opening up about the toll on his mental health after recent defeats in the ring - something he's encouraged others to do. He's spoken about the immense pressure he felt before the fight, and feeling as if he'd let fans down with his defeat. It's a similar weight to one he felt growing up - and one that could have led him down a very different path. AJ says peer pressure and the desire to fit in - feeling like you have to have ""material things"" - was something he faced in his youth. And the boxer, who was born in the UK to Nigerian parents, sees the same in young people growing up in diverse communities today. ""A lot of our parents are first generation immigrants - they moved to this country from another then had us,"" he says. ""I think that can lead to a culture clash between kids and parents. ""Parents haven't adjusted so how can the kids? I was doing certain things growing up and my parents may not have understood why I was doing the things I was doing."" AJ's speaking from experience - just a year before his life-changing Olympic medal win, he was arrested for possessing cannabis with intent to supply. So his other piece of advice is ""stay out of trouble and definitely jail"".  ""It ruins your chances of jobs, travel and all sorts in the future,"" he says. ""My past always catches up with me even today. It's still causing me a lot of headaches."" But he has a different outlook now. ""Let's say a pair of new Jordans are more important than me getting the best grades in school... versus if I get better grades for the next five years I can afford to buy that business myself,"" he says. ""Educate yourself, keep on trying, keep on training, you'll find your place. And if you do find your ways, try and bring other people through as well."" Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.

"""Dear younger me, you should have stayed out of tanning beds."" That's the message WWE wrestler Alexa Bliss had for herself after undergoing treatment for skin cancer. The 31-year-old, real name Lexi Cabrera, posted an Instagram photo over the weekend showing stiches where the cancer had been removed. She told fans she's ""all clear"" of the condition and urged them to ""always get your skin checked... if you are in the sun or use tanning beds"".  Sharing her story, five-time WWE Women's Champion Alexa said she'd noticed a spot on her face ""that had gotten worse"". ""So went to get a biopsy,"" she wrote. This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to read Twitter’s cookie policy, external and privacy policy, external before accepting. To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’. Alexa says she was diagnosed with a basal cell carcinoma, which usually starts as a lump or discoloured patch on the skin that doesn't go away. It can take months or sometimes years, but the carcinoma slowly spreads. It's most often found on areas regularly exposed to the sun, such as the face, ears, hands, shoulders, upper chest and back. The NHS says around 147,000 new cases of non-melanoma skin cancer are diagnosed in the UK each year.  It affects more men than women and is more common in the elderly. Skin cancer itself is one of the most common cancers in the world and the most serious type - melanoma - can be fatal.  Sunbeds work by exposing the skin to ultra-violet (UV) radiation, similar to that found in sunshine. This releases a chemical called melanin, which causes the skin to tan. However, while sunlight contains a mix of UVA and UVB radiation, sunbeds produce mainly UVA radiation, which penetrates deeper into your skin. It is estimated that 20 minutes on a sunbed can be equivalent to approximately four hours in the sun. Kathryn Clifford, co-founder of specialist skin cancer awareness charity SKCIN, says it's a ""common misconception that sunbeds are a safe alternative to tanning"". ""But that's not the case,"" she says. ""Sunbeds emit the same harmful ultraviolet radiation as the sun, causing cumulative and irreversible damage to the DNA in the skin's cells. ""That significantly increases a person's risk of developing both non-melanoma skin cancer - as in Alexa's case - and melanoma.""  If you're worried about skin cancer, Kathryn has some tips: In the UK, it's illegal to use UV tanning equipment if you're under 18. The NHS says that using sunbeds when you're under 25 can increase your risk of skin cancer in future. Research shows that UV light can also cause premature aging of the skin. According to the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE), sunbed operators should assess your skin type and give it a number between one and six. It says people with pale skin - types one and two - should avoid tanning equipment. For levels three and above, sunbed operators should advise you on how many minutes to limit your session to. The HSE says you should also avoid tanning if you get sunburnt easily, or have a family history of skin cancer. It also warns against using any accelerants, and says proper eye protection is essential. You can read the HSE's guidance in full on its website. Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.

"When you think of small music venues Adele and Ed Sheeran might not be the first names that spring to mind.  But both are just two of the UK's biggest artists who started their careers in grassroots venues.  Those small bars, pubs and clubs - a crucial springboard for new acts - are struggling, with a charity now predicting one could be lost each week. The Music Venue Trust says 2023 will be the worst year for closures since it formed in 2014.  Singer-songwriter CMAT is also worried about the future of grassroots music. Speaking to BBC Newsbeat backstage at London's Royal Albert Hall, she's about to support Grammy-winning duo Wet Leg at their Teenage Cancer Trust gig. CMAT, real name Ciara Thompson, recently won Ireland's Choice Music Prize for Best Album of the Year, and she's under no illusions about how she's got to where she is. ""I literally wouldn't have a career if it wasn't for open mic nights in small venues,"" she says. ""That was literally the first five years of my career - turning up on a Tuesday night with my guitar and asking 'can I do my songs now?'"" she says. But, since the pandemic, and the cost-of-living crisis that's followed, more and more small venues are disappearing. According to the Music Venue Trust, 22 grassroots venues have closed for good since April 2022. The charity expects more will go - possibly one a week - once government energy bill support for small businesses is cut back from 1 April. CMAT fears losing too many pubs and clubs will lead to music being dominated by those who've made a name through TikTok or privileged artists who ""start off on an elevated platform"". It's something singer and rapper Berwyn can relate to. ""Smaller venues were incredibly important to my career,"" he tells Newsbeat. The 26-year-old is now signed to a major label and playing shows across the UK, but says performing at local venues was ""training"" for bigger things.  ""The industry works in a larger format, you climb up from level to level and before you know it you're at Madison Square, you're at Wembley, but that level system is important."" ""Things have to develop naturally, you can't put a seed in the ground and expect it to go up and then then go down and and come back up again."" Berwyn says it's important for ""everyday people"" with big ambitions to ""have the opportunity to to play small venues and increase and grow"". ""Where would Ed Sheeran be without small venues? Where would Adele be without small venues? These are some of the most important artists in the culture of our times."" Ben Morgan is the events manager at the Snug in Atherton, near Bolton, Greater Manchester.  Like other small venues, it relies on ticket and bar sales to make a profit, but ""footfall is down because people have less money to come out,"" says Ben. The cost-of-living crisis has also hit bar sales. ""So not only do we have fewer people in the venue, but the people who do come are unable to spend as much money as they did before,"" says Ben. That's having an effect on line-ups - Ben would like to put lesser-known bands on the bill, but rising costs mean he's stuck to more recognised names guaranteed to bring in customers.  And it's this, Ben argues, that's damaging the music industry.  ""Without us there is no stepping stone for them,"" he says.  ""You will see fewer and fewer acts being able to make it to the big stage.  ""They won't have that practice, they won't have those skills from performing at grassroots music venues like ours to take on further in their career"". Music Venue Trust CEO Mark Davyd agrees that the ""entire music industry"" should be ""very worried about the future"".  Most have a ""really, really tough relationship with landlords,"" Mark tells Newsbeat, and one of the biggest issues is that most venues don't own the buildings they're based in. It's why the trust launched a new scheme last year - allowing fans to buy shares in venues to enable the charity to purchase them. The Snug was among nine venues selected for the pilot project when its former owners put it up for sale. If the fundraising project is successful it will be able to pay a reduced rent to the trust,  Ben says this will help to ""secure the long-term future of The Snug"" and the other eight sites. Trust CEO Mark says energy bills are ""completely absurd"" at present still a big problem for venues. He wants the government to do more to help. Creative Industries Minister Julia Lopez is due to meet the trust to discuss issues facing the live music sector. A spokesperson for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport told Newsbeat it was doing all it could to support grassroots venues - ""the lifeblood of our world-leading music sector"".  They said £1.57bn had been given out in the pandemic through the Culture Recovery Fund, and further help was being provided through the Supporting Grassroots Live Music fund via Arts Council England.

"Avon and Somerset police refer themselves to IOPC after fatal assault on 86-year-old in Somerset A man is being held in a secure mental health unit after an 86-year-old woman died in an attack at her cottage in a Somerset village. Avon and Somerset police have referred themselves to the police watchdog with regards to the action they took after a missing person report hours before the fatal assault. The woman has been named locally as Beryl “Bez” Purdy, who was well known in the village of Broomfield, near Taunton. Officers were called out to a reported burglary at about 5.45pm on Monday. When they arrived, they found Purdy badly injured. Paramedics and police officers tried to save her but were unsuccessful. A murder investigation led by the force’s major crime investigation team has been launched and a postmortem was conducted on Tuesday, but formal identification has not yet taken place. Police said a man in his 30s was arrested in connection with the incident. He was assessed by a mental health professional and deemed unfit for interview or to be detained in police custody. He was sectioned on Tuesday night under the Mental Health Act and transferred to a secure unit. The neighbourhood chief inspector, Justin French, said: “Our thoughts remain with the family during this incredibly difficult time and they are being supported by specially trained family liaison officers. “Incidents of this kind are rare and understandably can cause concern among the community. “Our officers will be out and about conducting reassurance patrols and we encourage people to speak to them with any questions and concerns they may have. “The public can expect to see an increased police presence in the area for the next few days.” The force added: “A mandatory conduct referral has been made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) concerning the action taken following a missing person report made earlier in the day.” It refused to give more details. Flowers were left near the scene paying tribute to Purdy. One tribute said: “Bez – there are no words. Out thoughts are with you and your family.’’ In December 2020, Purdy was pictured in the Somerset County Gazette outside St Mary and All Saints church, where she was a warden, after it received a grant to help repairs. She was also the booking secretary for Broomfield village hall and it is understood that she cared for her husband, Peter. In 2012, Purdy’s 46-year-old daughter, Alison, a police officer, diedafter a horse riding accident. The IOPC said it was assessing Avon and Somerset’s referral. ",Sad

"MP Julian Knight, who has always denied any wrongdoing, says he is facing a ‘witch-hunt’, and that whips’ office ‘acted disgracefully’ MP Julian Knight said he is facing a “witch-hunt” after his call for restoration of the Tory whip was rejected over “further complaints” made against him. The Conservative party said on Wednesday that it would not restore the whip to Knight after police dropped an investigation into an allegation of serious sexual assault against him. The MP for Solihull had always strongly rejected any wrongdoing after the complaint was made about him to the Metropolitan police, saying he had been targeted by unfounded rumours and blackmail. The Metropolitan police confirmed it was no longer investigating the matter. Knight, who was suspended from the Conservative party over the claim, always denied the allegation and demanded the “immediate” return of the party whip. However, a spokesperson for chief whip, Simon Hart, said Knight would not have the whip restored “following further complaints made to the whips’ office”. “These complaints, if appropriate, will be referred to the relevant police force, or appropriate bodies,” they said. Scotland Yard received an allegation of serious sexual assault on 28 October last year, and on 7 December a further referral relating to the incident was made, prompting an investigation into Knight. No details of the allegation were released at the time. Knight criticised the whips’ office, accusing it of a “desperate attempt to cover up the identities and motives of those in parliament who colluded for many months to bring the false allegation against me to the police”. “The police have confirmed today that there is no evidence to support that allegation and closed their investigation. They did not even need to interview me to do so,” he said. “Yet the whips’ office now seems intent on continuing a witch-hunt against me in an attempt to prevent my naming names.” Knight also criticised the Tory whips’ office for “acting disgracefully” by removing his anonymity when the further complaint was made. “The fact is that there was never anything for the police to investigate. This was a single, false and malicious allegation initially brought to them by third parties, each of whom had their own clear motives for doing so. “In publicly naming me in connection with the allegation, the Conservative whips’ office acted disgracefully and in breach of natural justice by removing my anonymity. Their actions meant my name was dragged through the mud and my good reputation immeasurably damaged. “The conduct of one person in the whips’ office, and the language used towards me, was particularly egregious. “Had the police taken the simple step at outset of interviewing me under caution, they would have seen that the allegation was false and scandalous. Instead, they waited four months, without ever talking to me, before deciding there was nothing for them to investigate.” Last month, Knight complained to the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, about the handling of the allegation, writing to the police chief to call the investigation “flawed and fundamentally unjust”. Knight, who chairs the Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, has been an MP since 2015. ",Provoking

"Associated Newspapers lawyers argue key witness’s ‘retraction’ reason to dismiss phone hacking allegations Prince Harry’s case against the owner of the Daily Mail depends on an alleged confession from an unreliable private investigator who has recanted his evidence, according to the publisher’s lawyers. The royal alleges that Associated Newspapers, the parent company of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, made widespread use of illegal information-gathering tactics including phone hacking, landline interception and the blagging of personal information. Harry’s accusations rely partly on evidence from a lengthy witness statement signed in 2021 by a private investigator, Gavin Burrows, and released to journalists on Wednesday. In that statement, Burrows claims that he and his team obtained information, hacked voicemails, tapped landline phones and bugged cars on behalf of journalists. He also goes into detail about how he allegedly tapped Elton John’s domestic landline, bugged cars belonging to Hugh Grant and Carole Middleton, the mother of the Princess of Wales, and targeted Harry’s girlfriends. Burrows described how he engaged in illegal activities on behalf of the Mail on Sunday, describing it as “one of my biggest and most regular clients”. In the witness statement, which continues over more than 20 pages, Burrows apparently admits to a wide variety of crimes and states that he targeted “thousands” of people on behalf of the Mail on Sunday. But Adrian Beltrami KC, representing Associated Newspapers, told the high court on Wednesday that these claims were now “directly contradicted” by a second witness statement from Burrows. In this new statement, signed three weeks ago and provided to Associated Newspapers, the private investigator recants his previous confession. He now says he was never asked to “conduct unlawful information gathering” by the Daily Mail or Mail on Sunday, and denies being paid in cash for work on behalf of the newspaper. Beltrami, who is attempting to have the case thrown out of court before it goes to a trial, said that raises serious questions about the “credibility and reliability” of Burrows’ original accusations. Harry, who had been in court for the first two days of legal argument, did not appear at the central London venue on Wednesday. He is bringing his case as part of a group of seven prominent individuals allegedly targeted by Associated Newspapers, which also includes Doreen Lawrence, Elton John, David Furnish, Elizabeth Hurley, Sadie Frost and Simon Hughes. Their cases rely on evidence from other private investigators, but Burrows’ original witness statement makes some of the more lurid claims. The judge, Mr Justice Nicklin, observed that Harry and his fellow claimants “may need to adjust their expectations” regarding the use of Burrows’ evidence. However, in a boost for Harry and the other claimants, the judge hinted that he may be inclined to allow the case to proceed to the next stage, observing that the quality of evidence is a matter for legal debate. “There is a trial point if ever I have seen one,” said Nicklin. Associated Newspapers denies the allegations and is trying to stop the cases going to a full trial. The company’s lawyers spent Wednesday arguing at the high court that Harry and his fellow claimants missed a legal deadline to file the paperwork so the cases should be stopped from proceeding any further. The company’s lawyers said the group of individuals should have suspected they were the potential victims of illegal behaviour at a much earlier stage, when phone hacking was first in the news more than a decade ago or they first saw suspicious articles. Lawyers acting for Harry and the other claimants argue that it was not possible to bring the cases earlier because they had not seen any evidence that suggested they were potential victims of illegal behaviour. They also argued that leading executives at the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, including the former editor Paul Dacre, had repeatedly denied any illegality took place at their newspapers, which they claimed was tantamount to concealing the alleged wrongdoing.

"Tory MPs at odds with No 10 over commitment to end crossings, with PM’s office saying he set no deadline The government has pledged to move asylum seekers into disused military bases with the minimum living conditions allowed under international law, but has come under pressure from ministers whose constituencies would host the camps. Rebel Conservative backbenchers warned that they expected Rishi Sunak’s pledge to stop small boat crossings to be fulfilled by the end of the year, a timetable rejected by Downing Street and one that could potentially lead to an internal split. Announcing the plan to stop housing asylum seekers in hotels while their claims are processed, Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, said the UK could stop incentives to cross the Channel only by being as ruthless as the people smugglers. “They are some of the most evil, most pernicious people in society. You have to match them – you cannot behave in a way that is weak and naive,” he told MPs. The asylum seeker camps would meet international legal requirements to ensure that those who arrived were not made destitute, Jenrick said, with shelter in “repurposed barrack blocks and Portakabins” and basic medical care, but nothing that could act as “a magnet” for displaced people. “Accommodation for migrants should meet their essential living needs and nothing more,” Jenrick said. “We must not elevate the wellbeing of illegal migrants above those of the British people.” The plan, involving the use at least three former bases, prompted immediate condemnation from campaign groups, with the Refugee Council saying they were unworkable and “not who we are as a country”. It also remains to be seen how effective the policy will be, with the planned accommodation on disused bases, totalling 4,900 spots, amounting to less than a tenth of the 51,000 people currently housed in hotels. Another complication is that two of the three planned bases are in the constituencies of government ministers, both of whom have expressed displeasure at the plans, while the third faces a legal challenge from the council, supported by the local Conservative MP. Under the plans, up to 1,700 people would be eventually housed at a disused defence site at Wethersfield in Essex; 2,000 more at a former RAF base at Scampton in Lincolnshire; and 1,200 at an RAF site turned prison in Bexhill, East Sussex. James Cleverly has previously spoken out against the use of the Wethersfield site, in his Braintree constituency. In a statement on Wednesday the foreign secretary said he had been given assurances about local safety but said the decision “isn’t the result my constituents and I wanted”. Huw Merriman, the rail minister, also expressed concern about the choice of the Northeye site at Bexhill, in his constituency, saying this would be “of great concern to local residents”. Edward Leigh, the Tory MP whose Gainsborough constituency contains RAF Scampton, which was the base for the Dambusters bomber squadron in the second world war, said the council would seek an injunction to stop it being used. In a separate internal row, Tory rebels who threatened earlier this week to push through amendments to the illegal migration bill, which pledges to deport and permanently bar from the UK anyone who arrives unofficially, reiterated their push for rapid action.A spokesperson for the rebels, who dropped their amendments after ministers assured them they would remove more legal safeguards for asylum seekers, said they understood Sunak’s pledge to stop small boats, in a speech in January setting out five policy pledges, to mean this would happen during 2023. Sign up to First Edition Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning after newsletter promotion “We understood the speech was crystal clear that we are going to stop the boats by the end of the year,” the spokesperson said. “Stop the boats, halve inflation, grow the economy – these were all promises to be fulfilled by the end of the year.” However, Downing Street said on Wednesday this was not the case. The prime minister’s spokesperson said: “We haven’t set a deadline for it. We recognise that it’s a complex problem, and obviously some of the elements that we believe will solve it are subject to judicial challenge.” Sunak dwelt on the issue at length in his January speech, but the ambiguity of his promise has caused problems for Downing Street since. The prime minister said at the time: “We will halve inflation, grow the economy, reduce debt, cut waiting lists and stop the boats. Those are the people’s priorities, they are your government’s priorities, and we will either have achieved them or not.”The impasse threatens a renewal of hostilities with Tory rebels, reported to number up to 60, who were persuaded to back down after ministers and Downing Street officials assured them their concerns would be reflected in later versions of the migration bill. The rebel MPs, led by the Devizes MP Danny Kruger, were due to hold talks with the government over the Easter recess, which begins on Thursday. Even as it stands, the illegal migration bill has been roundly condemned by rights groups and refugee charities. On Wednesday, the Council of Europe’s group of experts on action against trafficking in human beings (Greta) took the highly unusual step of expressing concern about the bill and its lack of compliance with core elements of the council’s convention on action against trafficking in human beings. The planned law, which would not usually allow asylum seekers to avoid deportation even if they were trafficked or slaves, is a “significant step backwards” in the fight against human trafficking and modern slavery, the group said.

"Incident at Saltburn-by-the-Sea occurs in same area as number of die-offs reported in 2021 and 2022 Thousands more dead or dying shellfish have washed up on a beach on the same stretch of coast that saw a number of crustacean die-offs in autumn 2021 and last year. Visitors to Saltburn-by-the-Sea, a few miles south-east of the River Tees, were met by the sight of hundreds of thousands of dead mussels on the shoreline, as well as starfish, crabs and razor clams. Stuart Marshall, 58, who owns beach huts on the promenade, was mounting a clean-up on the sands. He said: “It’s devastating. There’s starfish dead, clams, oysters and crabs.” He questioned one possible official explanation that rough seas had killed the creatures, as he said the waters had recently been calm. Helen Whitworth, from Northallerton, North Yorkshire, was walking her border collie Drako on the beach. She said: “There’s all sorts of debris here. I’ve come down for a lovely walk with the dog and it’s such a shame to see all of this today.” There was confusion over a large deposit of black debris, which some said was sea coal, a type of coal that periodically washes up on the beach. Marshall, who has run the huts for almost seven years, said he did not believe the particles were coal, adding: “We do get bits of coal from time to time but not anything like this.” The Environment Agency said its experts concluded the wash-up was “a natural event” and “normal for this time of year”. A spokesperson said: “We can confirm the black substance washed up on the beach is coal deposit, which is not unusual for this stretch of coastline. This is likely to be in the intertidal system for a while given recent weather conditions, so may continue to happen in the coming weeks and months. “Creatures like starfish, razor clams and mussels occupy similar rocky habitat and are easily dislodged during storm events. And the physiology of juvenile flounder makes them vulnerable to being stranded on shallow gradient beaches such as Saltburn. “While we know people are concerned, the combination of recent heavy swell, spring tides and onshore winds means natural wash-ups will occur more often.” The mass die-off on the north-east coast in late 2021 prompted a series of investigations. In January this year, a panel of independent experts convened by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs concluded: “A novel pathogen is considered the most likely cause of mortality.” However, the panel was “unable to identify a clear and convincing single cause for the unusual crustacean mortality”. Some campaigners have feared that dredging for a new freeport on the Tees was linked to the die-off, but the Tees Valley mayor, Ben Houchen, has strongly disputed those claims. ",Provoking

"David Redfern dragged Margaret Barnes downstairs by her ankles and kicked and stamped on her last July A man with anger issues has been found guilty of the murder of a confused 71-year-old woman who mistook his Welsh seaside home for a B&B and got into his bed. When David Redfern, 46, found Margaret Barnes in his room in July last year, he dragged her downstairs by her ankles and kicked and stamped on her, Caernarfon crown court heard. Barnes, from Birmingham, who was described by her family as a much-loved wife, mother and grandmother, had been due to stay at a B&B on Marine Parade in Barmouth, north-west Wales, where Redfern lived. After a night out, she mistakenly went into Redfern’s house, walked straight up to his bedroom and fell asleep, the court heard. Michael Jones KC, prosecuting, described it as a “mistake that ultimately cost her her life”. Opening what he called a “bizarre” case, Jones said Redfern was a 21st (133kg), 6ft 1in “bully” with anger issues who launched an “utterly gratuitous” attack on the 5ft 5in Barnes, causing the sort of internal damage seen after road crashes. After the attack, Redfern refused to call an ambulance and hurled insults at his victim as she lay dying outside his five-storey townhouse. In police bodycam footage shown in court, Redfern said: “I threw her out the bedroom, dragged her down the stairs by her ankles and threw her out the door. You do not expect to find someone else in your bed. I just wanted to get this strange woman out of the house.” In CCTV footage, he was heard telling his partner, Nicola Learoyd-Lewis: “I didn’t mean to kill her.” She replied: “You could have just escorted her out. It’s an old lady.” Questioned in court by his barrister, Mark Cotter KC, Redfern claimed he found Barnes in his bed drinking and smoking, her false teeth on a bedside table. He said: “She was sitting up with pillows propped up. She had a bottle of gin. She had a glass in her hand. The room stank of smoke.” Redfern said there was a black travel case open on the floor and clothes strewn around the room. He said he asked “Who the hell are you?” and he claimed she told him it was her room. Redfern claimed Barnes became aggressive and lunged at his partner after the police were called. He claimed there was accidental contact during the confrontation but denied murder. After the verdict, Barnes’s family said: “As a family it has been the hardest time of our lives. It has been especially difficult for Margaret’s husband, who had been her partner for 56 years. We now have some sort of closure on what has happened; however, no length of sentence will ever fill the void that Margaret has left behind.” Redfern has been told he will be jailed for life, and on Friday he will learn from the judge Mr Justice Bourne what minimum term he will serve.

"Exclusive: Sweeping review of relationship between faith and state will call for crackdown on oppression and radicalisation Ministers should be more aggressive in tackling oppression, violence and radicalisation in religious settings, according to what is set to be the most sweeping review of the relationship between faith and the state in recent times. Several sources have told the Guardian that the report, by Colin Bloom, will make recommendations urging action on issues ranging from unregulated faith schools to forced marriage and religious nationalism. It is due to be unveiled by Michael Gove’s Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities within weeks. Some of the recommendations, including a call to monitor unregistered and part-time schools, threaten to trigger a row with faith leaders, who have previously resisted such attempts by ministers to intervene in religious affairs. The recommendations are also likely to bolster Gove’s calls for stricter oversight of Islamic groups in particular, which have sparked anger among British Muslims in the past. One person familiar with large parts of the report said: “I have never seen a report on religion and the state which is this comprehensive. Colin [Bloom] has gone in depth into many areas of public and religious life from which ministers normally stay well away.” Bloom is a former head of the Conservative Christian Fellowship, a group of young Christians who helped put religion back at the heart of the party’s thinking after the Thatcher years. He was appointed in 2019 to lead a review of the government’s engagement with various faiths but it was delayed repeatedly, notably by the Covid pandemic. Bloom has spent the last few years speaking to religious and secular groups, and those involved in some of those discussions say they expect the final report to be broader than any previous such review. Richy Thompson, the director of public affairs at Humanists UK, said: “In the past the government has sometimes been nervous about tackling problems caused by religious groups, but those problems can extend to the most extreme forms of abuse. If this report is to see the government change tack here, then that is to be welcomed.” Those close to the process say much of the final report will talk about the positive impact of religion and formal worship on adherents and society more widely. Some of the proposals will be designed to bolster religion as a core element of British society, including more resources for religious education to be taught in schools, and more money to hire chaplains in prisons, schools and universities. But many of the most eye-catching sections will be contained in a section dealing with the harms that religious groups can cause. In one part of the report, Bloom will urge ministers to tackle the problems caused by unregistered faith schools, where concerns have been raised about abuse and radicalisation. Conservative ministers have attempted to regulate such schools before but have been forced to back down amid outcries from mainstream religious groups. David Cameron wanted to clamp down on Islamic madrasas in the wake of the “Trojan horse” affair in 2015, by allowing Ofsted inspectors to visit any institution where children under 19 are taught for more than six hours a week. That push was controversial at the time with Islamic groups, who said they were being singled out unfairly based on flimsy evidence about systemic radicalisation within their community. But it was the opposition of Christian groups that reportedly caused Cameron to drop the plans altogether, after the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, warned that it would make running Sunday schools harder. Similar objections were raised last year when ministers proposed a new schools bill that would have introduced a register of children not in school, after numbers rocketed post-Covid. The bill was eventually scrapped in December as part of a broader overhaul of government priorities by the new prime minister, Rishi Sunak. The issue has come to the fore in recent months, however. The Times revealed abuse and poor educational standards at ultra-Orthodox Jewish schools. Sign up to First Edition Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning after newsletter promotion Bloom will also push the government to do more to tackle forced marriages, and will ask for greater resources to help support those trying to leave controlling religious groups. Yehudis Fletcher, the co-founder of Nahamu, a thinktank countering extremism within the Jewish community, was one of those consulted during the review process. She said: “There is no excuse for these harms to be ignored, for these people to be left to suffer without intervention by the state.” But a Muslim Council of Britain spokesperson said: “There remains a lack of any meaningful engagement by government with diverse British Muslim communities … We would hope that the Bloom report recognises how vital it is for the government to establish meaningful engagement with British Muslim communities more broadly and the key role Muslim-led representative bodies can play in facilitating this.” In another notable section, Bloom will tackle the sensitive issue of religious nationalism, especially within south Asian communities. He will say Hindu nationalism is common within the UK but that Sikh nationalism could pose a bigger threat, given the success of some hardline groups in gaining access to senior politicians. Sikh nationalists have been in dispute with the Indian government for decades over their desire for an independent state in the Punjab region. The issue is a highly sensitive topic in UK-India relations, with the Indian government recently summoning the British high commissioner in Delhi for a dressing-down after Sikh protesters attacked the Indian high commission in London. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: “Colin Bloom has been undertaking an independent review into how the government engages with faith organisations as part of his role as faith engagement adviser. The report will be published in due course.” ",Provoking

"Farmers Weekly reports that leading UK food manufacturer supplied supermarkets with sometimes rotten meat Foreign pork falsely labelled as British appears to have been sold by leading supermarkets, according to a new report released as the Food Standards Agency (FSA) launched an investigation into supply chain fraud. An investigation by the trade publication Farmers Weekly has found that until at least the end of 2020, one of the UK’s top food manufacturers has been selling mislabelled and sometimes rotten meat to retailers. Meat produced by the company is reported to have ended up in products such as ready meals, quiches, sandwiches and other produce sold in Tesco, Asda, Co-op, Morrisons and Marks & Spencer. The investigation found that each week, tens of thousands of tonnes of foreign pork mislabelled as British found its way into the supply chain. The processor, which has not yet been named by the FSA, has also been accused by former employees of regularly “washing” visibly off hams in salt water, and of mixing rotting pork with fresh product for further processing. Darren Davies, head of the FSA’s national food crime unit (NFCU), said: “[We are] carrying out a criminal investigation into how a supplier was allegedly providing products labelled as British when they were in fact sourced from elsewhere. “This is a complex and live investigation and we are looking into all new lines of enquiry with our partner organisations, including any potential food hygiene breaches at the premises. If any evidence of a food safety risk is found, then necessary action will be taken. “The FSA advised retailers last year to check their cooked meat supply chain and to apply extra due diligence in their checks. We don’t give out these alerts without a reason. “We will not name the supplier while we painstakingly gather evidence to support our investigation so as not to prejudice any possible future action by the courts.” Davies warned that the cost of living crisis could mean that food fraud increases as suppliers face pressure to turn a profit. He said: “As a national regulator, we are the last line of defence. At a time when cost pressures and other challenges mean the risks of food fraud might be increasing, it is vital that everyone involved in the food system remains extra vigilant to ensure that food is safe and what it says it is.” On behalf of all the affected supermarkets, the British Retail Consortium said: “The role of the FSA is to work with retailers to prevent fraud. While we cannot comment on an ongoing investigation, retailers will support the FSA with its investigation into the individual supplier in question.” Sign up to First Edition Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning after newsletter promotion A Marks & Spencer spokesperson said that none of their raw materials are from the supplier involved.

M&S does not take any product from the company in question. Neither M&S or any of our suppliers are being investigated by the NFCU.” Farmers Weekly said British farmers had been “ripped off” by mislabelled meat, and called for tighter regulations to prevent the recurrence of the practice. Andrew Meredith, the magazine’s editor, said: “When trade deals are being signed that will allow the flow of imports into the country ever more easily, it is essential that the provenance of homegrown produce is stronger than ever. “We cannot and should not be able to compel consumers to only buy British, but there must be an ironclad guarantee that when they choose to do so, they are getting the real deal.” ",Provoking

"Prime minister’s failure to raise wife’s childcare agency when questioned by MPs raises concern Rishi Sunak is facing questions over a potential conflict of interest after it emerged a childcare firm part owned by his wife is to benefit from major changes in the budget. The prime minister’s wife, Akshata Murty, is listed as a shareholder in Koru Kids, a childcare agency. Koru Kids is likely to benefit from a pilot scheme offered by Jeremy Hunt to incentivise people to become childminders, with £1,200 offered to those who train to become one through an agency. Sunak did not mention his wife’s interest when speaking about the childcare changes at his appearance before the liaison committee on Tuesday. He was asked by the Labour MP Catherine McKinnell whether he had anything to declare. “No, all my disclosures are declared in the normal way,” he told McKinnell. It is understood the Cabinet Office was told about Murty’s interest in Koru Kids previously but it was not deemed necessary to appear on the public register of ministerial interests, which was last updated in June 2022. The register states that Sunak’s wife owns a venture capital investment company, Catamaran Ventures UK Ltd, without going into detail of any of its shareholdings. Following the reports, first revealed by the i newspaper, the Liberal Democrats called on Sunak to make sure he had not broken the ministerial code in the way that he has dealt with the interest. Wendy Chamberlain, the Lib Dem chief whip, wrote to Sir Laurie Magnus, the independent adviser on ministerial interests, drawing attention to the ministerial code provision which seeks ministers to ensure “that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise”, and that they must “scrupulously avoid any danger of an actual or perceived conflict of interest between their ministerial position and their private financial interests”. “They should be guided by the general principle that they should either dispose of the interest giving rise to the conflict or take alternative steps to prevent it,” the code says. Chamberlain said: “The prime minister’s family does appear to have a relevant financial interest in Koru Kids – which has benefited from a recent change to government policy. There is a clear question as to whether articles 7.1 and 7.7 of the ministerial code have been breached. “I therefore urge you to investigate whether the code has been broken; and if it has not, what steps the prime minister took to ensure that no conflict arose. In particular please set out whether he made you or other senior officials aware of the financial interest in Koru Kids when the childcare policy was being developed.” Magnus is not able to open his own investigations without the permission of the prime minister. Sign up to The Guardian Headlines UK A digest of the morning's main headlines emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion Speaking after prime minister’s questions, Sunak’s spokesperson said he had told the No 10 permanent secretary of any relevant interests when he took the job. The government and independent adviser on ministerial interests will publish an annual statement of all those interests in May. However, there is a question of whether Commons rules mean he should have declared it when speaking about childcare at the liaison committee. “He has followed the process in terms of declaring his interests as set out in the ministerial code,” the spokesperson said. It is understood the government considers that a Commons declaration is not relevant in relation to Sunak’s family interest because any potential conflict would already have been addressed and mitigated under the ministerial declaration process. But Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “Rishi Sunak must explain why he failed to come clean when asked about the shares his family held in a company now set to financially benefit from a childcare policy announced in his budget. “He must urgently correct the record and set out what steps he took to avoid an actual or perceived conflict of interest. No proper explanation has yet been provided by the prime minister as to why this was not deemed necessary to publish in the register of members’ interests.” ",Controversial

"Objectors say placement of lifesize statue near city’s cathedral is ‘disrespectful’, but artist says work celebrates love and hope A row has erupted in the cathedral city of Wakefield in West Yorkshire over a “disrespectful” Amazonian love god statue due to be installed as part of the city’s £1m art trail. The artist Jason Wilsher-Mills has been forced to defend his 1.9 metre (6ft 3in) bronze work after people said its placement so close to Wakefield Cathedral, outside the entrance of the Ridings shopping centre, was a “mockery of Christianity”. Wakefield council’s planning website received more than 60 objections to the work of art, including claims that the figure would be “an offence to Christian worshippers, and what we believe”, “disrespectful to the Christian faith” and a “mockery of Christianity as a whole”. Another said putting “a symbol of a sun god in the vicinity of the cathedral” would be “an affront to our Christian heritage and our identity as a cathedral city”. The work, titled Amazonian Caiman God, is inspired by the artist’s childhood in Wakefield, and he said the central message was “love and hope”. In notes explaining the artwork, he said it depicts “an Amazonian Caiman god, who would be holding the two lovers in his right hand, and making sure mum and dad arrived on the ferry boat to Walton Hall, the home of Squire Waterton”. Wilsher-Mills, a disabled artist, who has used a wheelchair since the age of 11, said: “This would serve as a metaphor for caring for the Earth, as well as being about personal love stories.” He added that his work “celebrates disability, my northern working-class heritage and popular culture, through cutting-edge technologies and brightly coloured, large scale humorous, but challenging art”. There are not thought to be plans to change the locations in the trail, which would give people in Wakefield a “real sense of pride in our fascinating history and heritage and connect key points of the city together while ensuring that everyone is able to access culture and enjoy it”, the Wakefield councillor Michael Graham said in December when the plan was announced.

"Scheduling makes Wales hearing look like ‘poorer relative’, say unions, while NI families say at least six weeks is needed Bereaved families have strongly criticised proposals by the UK Covid-19 inquiry to set aside only three weeks each for its public hearings on the responses to the pandemic in Wales and Northern Ireland. Members of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru argued that the Labour-led Welsh government would escape proper scrutiny unless more time was allocated. Trade union leaders suggested there was a risk Wales could be seen as the “poorer relative” in the inquiry. The Northern Ireland Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group said at least six weeks should be given to examining how the pandemic was dealt with there. During preliminary hearings on Wednesday, it emerged that the Welsh hearing is due to take place in February next year and the Northern Ireland hearing in April next year. The barrister Bethan Harris, representing the Welsh families’ group, said: “There is a deep concern that it’s proposed to cover the impact and handling of the pandemic [in Wales] within three weeks. “The group is concerned this may not allow for adequate scrutiny. There is no other inquiry for Wales, the first minister [Mark Drakeford] having refused a Wales-specific inquiry akin to the Scottish inquiry. It relies on this inquiry. The concern is the devolved Welsh government will escape full scrutiny.” Samuel Jacobs, representing Wales TUC Cymru, said the proposed hearing seemed “extraordinarily short” and continued: “It appears that the Wales hearing is the poorer relative of more robust consideration given in relation to Westminster decision-making. “There is also the problem of being able to meaningfully test an array of complex issues in a mere 13 or 14 days of evidence. The current estimate seems to be problematically short.” He called on Lady Hallett, the chair of the inquiry, to “grasp the nettle” and extend the Welsh hearing. Drakeford has repeatedly said a UK-wide inquiry is the best way to get to the truth of the Covid response because of the interconnected nature of the decisions made across the four countries.

Campbell added that the uncertain political situation meant there was no prospect of a specific Northern Ireland inquiry.

They are a vital part of the hearings.” After the hearing the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew RT Davies, described the time proposed as “compressed and limited”.

"Exclusive: extensive consultations since idea was proposed 18 months ago have found it would not be commercially viable Plans to boost domestic tourism by introducing a rail pass for British staycationers have been axed, the Guardian can reveal. The idea was initially heralded by the government as a way to help struggling businesses get back on their feet as the final Covid restrictions were being lifted in the summer of 2021, but extensive consultations since have found that the plan would not be commercially viable. Hospitality and tourism groups said they were disappointed by the move, while Labour said the “shambolic” state of the railways was harming interconnectivity. The special ticket was intended to be modelled on the BritRail pass, which is sold through VisitBritain and allows foreign tourists unlimited journeys on most train lines across England, Wales and Scotland. It is sold as a way of encouraging visitors to travel to attractions across the country, letting them “discover the hidden gems of Britain any time, on any train” and at “great value for money”. As the final unlocking of restrictions approached, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said in a widely reported announcement in June 2021 that a similar rail pass for staycationers would be launched “later this year”. However, more than 18 months later, the plan has not come to fruition. In an update to the tourism recovery plan quietly released this month, the department said that the “domestic rail tourism product” had been axed. Extensive research by DCMS, alongside the Department for Transport, the Rail Delivery Group and VisitBritain, found that such a product “would not provide value for money for customers” if it were commercially viable. “The government will work with VisitBritain and the rail operators to find alternative ways to encourage more people to use UK rail networks to enjoy the leisure and tourism offer around the country,” the document noted. The decision will come as a blow to struggling tourism and hospitality firms, which are already struggling given the cost of living crisis and high inflation. DCMS acknowledged this, saying the short-term focus was “still on recovery” – especially for parts of the country particularly damaged by the loss of tourist numbers and spending since 2019. Richard Toomer, the executive director of the Tourism Alliance and a member of the government’s Tourism Industry Council, said it was disappointing that the idea had been dropped. He said it would have been “a great way to encourage people to explore the regions and nations of the UK”, and that rail travel was “a very sustainable form of transport too”, helpful for travellers who are “keenly aware of wanting to travel sustainably”. Toomer said: “We raised this at a meeting of the Tourism Industry Council last week and we will be working with the government to understand the difficulties and seeing if there’s a way through them.” Sign up to The Guardian Traveller Get travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian Holidays after newsletter promotion Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of industry body UKHospitality, also said the decision was disappointing. “Throughout the pandemic we saw staycations rise in popularity, and a dedicated rail pass would have been a great way to incentivise consumers to continue spending time travelling and visiting places across the UK.” However, she added that it was positive that ministers were committed to exploring alternative ways to encourage people to use the railways for domestic travel. Labour called the decision “another broken promise from this government on our rail services”. Louise Haigh, the shadow transport secretary, said: “The shambolic state of our rail network is already hurting tourism and connectivity up and down the country. The next Labour government will put passengers back at the heart of our railways, better connecting the country and unlocking jobs and growth.” A government spokesperson said “extensive research” had been conducted with stakeholder groups, but it was concluded that “in order to be commercially viable, the product would not provide value for money for the public”.

"New first minister announces appointments as he seeks to move past divisive leadership contest Scotland’s new first minister, Humza Yousaf, has revealed a majority-female cabinet, with half its members under the age of 40, as his attempts to unite the party stalled after a divisive leadership contest. Kate Forbes, whom Yousaf narrowly beat to secure the SNP leadership on Monday, confirmed on Tuesday evening she would be leaving the Scottish government rather than accept a cabinet demotion. Allies of Forbes described the offer of the rural affairs and islands portfolio – a significant step down from her previous position as finance secretary – as “an insult”, while one of her early supporters, the business minister, Ivan McKee, also resigned from government on Wednesday morning after being offered what he considered to be a demotion. Yousaf unveiled the new cabinet team after he was officially sworn in as first minister at the court of session in Edinburgh on Wednesday morning, and said it reflected “the priorities that we will pursue as a government – including tackling child poverty, improving public services and building a fairer, greener economy”. He split Forbes’ previous role, giving the finance brief to his newly appointed deputy, Shona Robison, a key Sturgeon ally whom the former first minister entrusted to steer through her gender recognition reform bill, while his campaign manager, Neil Gray, joins cabinet for the first time as the secretary for wellbeing economy, fair work and energy. Robison, who is based in Dundee, stood down as health secretary in 2018 after months of intense criticism over her handling of NHS funding crises. Yousaf also lives in Dundee with his family, although he is MSP for the Glasgow Pollok constituency. Yousaf also promoted a number of younger colleagues, including Màiri McAllan, who becomes net zero and just transition secretary, and former teacher Jenny Gilruth, who takes over the education brief. He sacked the party’s deputy leader, Keith Brown, from his justice role, days after Brown set out a detailed manifesto for internal party change in an article for the Daily Record. Yousaf also promoted the former transport minister Michael Matheson to the health brief that he previously held, one of the most challenging roles in cabinet as the country faces record cancer and surgery waiting lists and record A&E delays. However, the profound divisions that emerged in the SNP leadership contest appeared to cement themselves despite Yousaf’s insistence during the campaign that he would depart from Nicola Sturgeon’s “inner circle” leadership style, promising a “big tent” approach. One of Forbes’s leading supporters, the former SNP minister Alex Neil, described Yousaf’s treatment of her as “an insult and not a real attempt to unite” after he narrowly beat Forbes to the leadership by 52% to 48% on second preferences. Robison insisted on Wednesday morning that Forbes had taken the decision to step back for personal reasons. She told the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland programme: “The very first meeting that the first minister had was with Kate, and he made clear that he wanted Kate to be in government. Sign up to First Edition Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning after newsletter promotion “They spoke on a number of occasions over the last two days and I understand that the discussion was very cordial and was very much centred on what Kate’s thoughts were. She had reflected upon how hard the campaign had been for family life and her desire for better life-work balance and that she decided that time out of the spotlight would be best, to spend time with [her] family.” Forbes is still technically on maternity leave until the end of the Easter recess, and gave birth to her first baby last August. Robison denied what was construed as a demotion was a signal to the 48% of the SNP membership who voted for Forbes that he was ignoring their views. After rejecting the role, Forbes tweeted that the new first minister had her “full support”, saying: “I have full confidence he will appoint a talented cabinet and ministerial team, able to meet the challenges facing the country.” ",Inspirational

"Welfare secretary says he will not appeal against ruling ordering DWP to release study Ministers have backed down over a refusal to publish “sensitive” internal government research into the effectiveness of benefit sanctions that has been kept under wraps by ministers for over two years. The welfare secretary, Mel Stride, told MPs on the work and pensions select committee that he would not appeal against an information watchdog ruling earlier this month ordering the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) to release the study. Sanctions are effectively fines – the average sanction is £660 – issued to claimants as punishment for infringing benefit conditions, such as not spending enough time searching for jobs, or failing to attend meetings with jobcentre work coaches. Interest in the findings of the DWP report, already intense, has grown since the government announced in the budget that it would apply sanctions “more rigorously” as part of its plans to force more people back into the labour market. The DWP study was commissioned in 2019 after a work and pensions select committee inquiry concluded, echoing comprehensive academic research, that while sanctions had little effect on getting people into work, they routinely impoverished claimants and damaged their mental health. Although the DWP initially pledged to publish the study, it emerged a year ago that the then welfare secretary, Thérèse Coffey, had blocked its release, insisting that it contained “details of a sensitive nature” and that it was in the “public interest” to keep the findings under wraps. The information commissioner rejected the DWP’s refusal to release the study in response to a Freedom of Information request, ruling that there was “strong public interest in scrutiny and understanding of the information available to those deciding whether to continue with a controversial policy such as sanctioning benefits”. Announcing on Wednesday that the study would be published, Stride defended his predecessor’s decision to block publication. “I do think it [the study] presents a very incomplete picture, and I do think the reasons and rationale for not releasing it were perfectly proper and acceptable,” he said. The normally self-assured Stride was discomfited by subsequent questions on sanctions policy by SNP MP David Linden. Stride admitted he had never knowingly met a sanctioned claimant, and was unaware how much the average sanctions penalty amounted to. Linden said he met people every week in his Glasgow East constituency who had been rendered destitute and mentally ill as a result of sanctions. He suggested Stride’s understanding of sanctions was “highly theoretical” and removed from reality “on the ground”. He added: “May I gently suggest, secretary of state, that if you are looking to get people back into work, plunging them into further poverty and destitution is not a particularly good way of doing that.” Stride vigorously defended sanctions, saying it was right that the DWP should attach conditions to benefits and that there were “consequences” for claimants who did not engage with attempts to get them into work. He was “satisfied overall” with the way the sanctions system worked, he told MPs. Sanctions were applied by officials in a “measured and proportionate” way, with a “safety net” built into the system in the form of access to hardship funds and the right of appeal to a tribunal. “It’s very easy to characterise officials and ministers and so on when sanctions are being described, and the effects of sanctions, as somehow being heartless and uncaring. That is most certainly not the case,” he said. ",Provoking

"Minister sets out plans to use old army bases and possibly ships to save money and dissuade people from coming to UK Asylum seekers will be housed in the most basic accommodation possible, including disused army bases and possibly ships, to save money and to dissuade people from coming to the UK, the government has said. In a Commons statement setting out the next stage in the plans to reduce asylum claims in the UK, Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, said the plans would meet legal requirements to ensure that those who arrived were not made “destitute”, but nothing more. “We must not elevate the wellbeing of illegal migrants above those of the British people,” he told MPs. In one answer, Jenrick appeared to argue that the government had to remove incentives to arrive by small boats by being as ruthless as people smugglers: “They are some of the most evil, most pernicious people in society. You have to match them – you cannot behave in a way that is weak and naive.” Jenrick’s plan won praise from many of his MPs, but was condemned by Labour as “an admission of failure”, while two ministers have voiced concern about housing asylum seekers on military sites in their constituencies. Jenrick confirmed plans to house people at the disused defence base at Wethersfield in Essex, the RAF base at Scampton in Lincolnshire, an RAF site turned prison in Bexhill, East Sussex, and the Catterick garrison in North Yorkshire. Ministers were also continuing to “explore the possibility of accommodating migrants in vessels”, he added, after reports that refugees could be kept on disused cruise ships or barges. Jenrick said the current cost of keeping people in hotels while their claims are assessed was too high and placed pressure on communities. He set out his intention to make the alternative accommodation as basic as allowed under international law. The proposal follows plans to bar people who arrive in the UK unofficially from ever being able to claim asylum or settle in the country. They will instead face deportation to Rwanda or another country. Given the scale of arrivals on boats across the Channel, “we must fundamentally alter our posture towards those who seek to enter our country illegally”, Jenrick said. “This government remains committed to meeting our legal obligations to those who would otherwise be destitute. But we are not prepared to go further. Accommodation for migrants should meet their essential living needs and nothing more. Because we cannot risk becoming a magnet for the millions of people who are displaced and seeking better economic prospects.” Jenrick also announced a funding package for councils that are using hotels, saying “several thousand” refugees would be kept in “repurposed barrack blocks and Portakabins” and military bases, with “basic healthcare” and 24-hour security. Such a spartan regime is likely to prompt more condemnation from refugee charities and human rights groups, which have already criticised the illegal migration bill that would bar those who arrive unofficially from making asylum claims in the UK. Responding to the statement, the Refugee Council said the plans were unworkable and “not who we are as a country”. Enver Solomon, its chief executive, said: “We should be providing accommodation which treats people with humanity, dignity and compassion, not barges and shipping containers.” It remains to be seen how easy it will be to roll out the plan of using military bases, let alone ships. Edward Leigh, the Conservative MP whose Gainsborough constituency contains RAF Scampton, which was the base for the Dambusters bomber squadron in the second world war, said the council would seek an injunction to stop it being used and that he supported it. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, has previously spoken out against the Wethersfield site, in his Braintree constituency, being used to house refugees. In a statement released as Jenrick spoke, Cleverly said the decision to use the base “isn’t the result my constituents and I wanted”, but that he had been given assurances about community safety. Huw Merriman, the rail minister, also expressed concern about the choice of the Northeye site in Bexhill, saying this would be “of great concern to local residents”. There were some wider worries expressed by Tory backbenchers in the chamber. Richard Drax, the South Dorset MP, said housing asylum seekers on boats would be deeply impractical and “utterly out of the question”. Edward Timpson, a Conservative former education minister, sought assurances that children would not be housed in the camps. Jenrick replied that they would be used only for “single adult males” and that children and families would be “properly supported”. The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said the plan was “an admission of failure” over the scale of the backlog in processing asylum claims. “They keep making new announcements, but it just keeps getting worse,” she said.

"UK chancellor tells MPs  high level of inflation means Treasury support is necessary to avoid cutting frontline services Jeremy Hunt has pledged to find additional money to help fund public sector pay deals after admitting that Britain’s high level of inflation has made it impossible for Whitehall departments to end strikes without Treasury support. The chancellor conceded on Wednesday that the only way the government could fund pay awards without cutting frontline services was if he provided financial support to cabinet colleagues. Speaking to the Treasury select committee, Hunt dropped his previous insistence that pay offers for doctors, nurses and teachers would have to be funded by departments making efficiency savings. The chancellor said that when the pay deals were completed, there would be “discussions with the Treasury” about the level of support. Making clear that the UK’s annual inflation rate of 10.4% created “special circumstances”, Hunt said there would need to be a deal on how much of the cost would be borne by the Treasury and how much through efficiency savings and reallocation of departmental budgets. “There will be discussions about how much help comes from the centre, but we haven’t had those discussions yet,” he said. The Treasury has a contingency reserve – a rainy-day fund – that Hunt can draw on to meet unforeseen spending needs. The chancellor said the government had made a commitment that there would be no cuts to frontline public services and that the discussions with departments would ensure that this pledge was met. Giving evidence to the committee of backbench MPs about his budget, Hunt said the annual inflation rate would fall in the coming months because last year’s sharp price rises in energy and food would not be repeated. However, he said the cost of living crisis was not over. “There are still inflationary pressures in the economy and I am very concerned about that.” Noting that inflation rose unexpectedly last month, the chancellor said: “We need to keep our eye on the ball. There is no room for complacency.” Hunt accepted that the highest inflation in four decades would lead to a 6% drop in living standards over two years. “I very much recognise the squeeze,” he said. “There is pressure on living standards. The long-term sustainable way to relieve that pressure is through economic growth.” Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion The chancellor said the budget had contained measures to boost Britain’s sluggish growth rate, but he admitted the government would need to mitigate the risks posed by Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) – a $369bn (£299bn) package of subsidies designed to encourage firms to invest in green technology in the US. The chancellor said it was a “good thing” the US was taking the climate crisis seriously, adding that there was an element of catch-up in the American approach. But he accepted that the IRA posed risks to the UK’s green sector that the government would need to counter. While rejecting the idea the UK could match the US “subsidy for subsidy”, Hunt said the overall package offered needed to be attractive to investors. Hunt told MPs he would come up with a more detailed response to the IRA, and to the EU’s green deal package, in his autumn statement later in the year. ",Controversial

"John Nicolson’s tweets were assessed by parliament’s grievance scheme in six-month investigation A Scottish National party (SNP) MP has been cleared of bullying the former cabinet minister Nadine Dorries after a six-month investigation. John Nicolson, the SNP’s culture secretary, is understood to have been cleared after parliament’s Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) assessed a series of tweets he made about Dorries while she was culture secretary in Boris Johnson’s cabinet. He criticised Dorries, calling her “a horrible disgusting woman”, “a “mendacious, vacuous Tory goon” and “thick as two short planks”. Nicolson liked the tweets posted by others after the pair engaged in a Commons select committee session, during which he questioned Dorries on her use of Twitter. After a number of exchanges during the digital, culture, media and sport committee hearing in November 2021, she said she was “not going to answer questions about tweets that I posted 12 years ago, or whenever it was”. At one point, Nicolson said: “It is hard to keep track of your tweets”, to which Dorries replied: “Not as hard as it is to keep track of yours.” The case was first reported by Politico UK. It marks the first case of a British politician being investigated by the ICGS over allegations of cyberbullying another MP. The ICGS was created in 2018 to get a grip on misconduct within parliament.

Therefore, we cannot provide any information on any complaint, including whether or not a complaint has been received.” The SNP MP for Ochil and South Perthshire remains the subject of a separate investigation by the Commons privileges committee after he was accused of a “clear breach” of parliamentary rules for tweeting details of a letter from Commons speaker Lindsay Hoyle.

James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, has already voiced his opposition to the Essex site, which is in his constituency. A separate site on private land in Bexhill, East Sussex, will also be used, while Jenrick said Rishi Sunak was “showing leadership” by “bringing forward proposals” to use barracks in Catterick Garrison in his own constituency of Richmond, Yorkshire. The advantages include that there is plenty of space to build facilities. But the government’s previous attempt to build a detention centre at a former RAF base in Linton-on-Ouse was scrapped after a local outcry and legal threats. Labour say that the proposals will not reduce spending, “contrary to all of the briefing in the papers”. They say the new sites are in addition to hotels, not replacements. The facilities themselves will face criticism and possible legal challenges for being “grossly inadequate” for people who have fled war, charities have said. It is a mark of desperation within Downing Street that the idea of housing in cruise ships – this time a former liner from Indonesia, the Guardian has disclosed – is once again gaining currency in Whitehall. Jenrick confirmed the government was continuing to “explore the possibility of accommodating migrants in vessels”. Sunak proposed putting migrants on cruise ships moored around the country last summer but was warned it could be illegal under the Human Rights Act and the European convention on human rights. Sources suggested, however, that the cruise ships could be registered as hotels rather than detention centres to get around possible legal challenges. Some ocean liners can carry 3,000 guests, and they could be adapted, if they remain at port, to carry hundreds more. Former ministers have said that the idea was examined last year, while an official 2022 report said it would be more expensive than housing people in hotels. Not only were the ships themselves hugely expensive to maintain, it was “near impossible” to find insurance cover. Ministers have also declined to rule out a future use of barges, large flat-bottomed boats that have been used to house offshore construction workers, according to the Times. Accommodation barges are typically used to house workers for construction projects at sea such as oil refineries or offshore wind turbines. While some are basic, others are described as “floating hotels” – or flotels – and include restaurants, fitness areas, bars, kitchens and laundry facilities. The vessels can house hundreds of people – some of the bigger ones can accommodate more than 600. One recent barge, measuring 120 metres by 31 metres and capable of housing 300 people, cost more than £20m. A company called DSB Offshore advertises such barges for sale in the Gulf – but a price is not attached to each advertised barge. Cabins are communal, with two to four people to a room and shared bathrooms. All cooking and cleaning is taken care of. Modern rigs feature gaming areas, gyms and even theatres. The government’s often-heralded plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda is still facing a number of challenges before it ever comes to fruition. The plan, first put forward by Boris Johnson and Priti Patel less than a year ago, was to send “tens of thousands” of asylum seekers to the central African country, where their cases would be assessed. Even if the refugees were granted leave to remain, they would be offered a new home in Rwanda, and not necessarily given a route to return to the UK. The idea, taken from a model first used in Australia, was based on the hope that it would put off those travelling across the Channel on small boats, and break the business model of smugglers. However, since the £140m plan was introduced, small boats crossings have soared and not a single plane has taken off to central Africa after legal challenges that could continue until the next general election. And the Rwandan government was forced to admit over the summer that they only had prepared accommodation to house several hundred people. Since then, Sunak and Braverman have gambled on the plan, coupled with hardline policies in the illegal migration bill, helping to put off asylum seekers from coming to the UK. A visit to Kigali last week by Braverman, which was widely ridiculed as a photo opportunity, aimed to assure Tory MPs and voters that the Rwandan government was building more accommodation. But other senior Conservatives have said that thousands of new places, funded by the UK taxpayer, will have to be built in Rwanda if the plan is to work. Patel told a newspaper that Home Office modelling showed many thousands of refugees would have to be successfully removed to Rwanda before a deterrent effect halts those seeking refuge in the UK.

"Former head of Conservative Christian Fellowship will look at religion’s positive impact as well as how faith groups cause harm  Ministers urged to be more aggressive in tackling issues within religious groups A sweeping review of the relationship between faith and the state in recent times is due to be published within weeks, urging ministers to crack down on oppression, violence and radicalisation in religious settings. The report, by Colin Bloom, will be unveiled by Michael Gove’s Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. While Westminster’s attention has been captured by the pandemic, Partygate and the mini-budget meltdown, Bloom has quietly been working on one of the most sweeping government investigations ever undertaken into religion in modern Britain. His remit was simply to review how best the government should engage with faith groups in the UK, and those close to the process say he has been rigorous in his fieldwork, talking to representatives from a range of faith groups. Much of Bloom’s report will lay out the positive impact he believes religion plays in society, something he will say was highlighted when Britain went into lockdown, closing many places of worship in the process. But some of the most interesting and controversial recommendations will deal with where he believes faith groups are causing harm. Many of his conclusions chime with those of his boss, Michael Gove, who has said for years that he believes Muslim madrasas in particular help foment radicalism – claims that have been disputed by Islamic organisations. Bloom was appointed in 2019 but his report has been delayed multiple times. First, the pandemic made it difficult for him to interview people, and then towards the end of last year, Gove decided he wanted to read the report himself before it was published. In the end, many of Bloom’s recommendations are timely: ultra-Orthodox Jewish schools have been in the news, while his warnings about Sikh nationalism will resonate after the recent attacks on the Indian high commission in London.

"Humza Yousaf must reunite the party, fill its coffers and face opposition MPs who believe he is the SNP’s weak point Humza Yousaf’s confirmation as Scotland’s new first minister, the sixth since the devolved parliament was convened in 1999, may well be the easiest task he faces during his first week in charge. Putting the vexed decisions about his policy agenda and spending plans to one side, he has a number of urgent and challenging tasks in the days ahead, within the party he now leads and the government he now has to establish. Yousaf has several key appointments to oversee in senior positions in the SNP, including that of the party’s chief executive and its head of communications at Holyrood, both of whom quit earlier this month in a scandal over misinformation about the party’s membership. First Murray Foote, the SNP’s communications chief in the parliament, quit after accusing other SNP officials of giving him incorrect figures on party membership numbers – those had fallen by 30,000, a fact he was told to deny. In the wake of Foote’s resignation, his boss Peter Murrell, the SNP’s chief executive for 20 years and Nicola Sturgeon’s husband, was confronted by senior officials in the SNP’s national committee. They told him to resign or face defeat in a motion of no confidence. The sharp drop in membership exposed a funding crisis for the SNP: it relies on subscriptions for more than half its income, and is in debt – losing £750,000 in 2021 and with additional debts then of over £1m. He needs to fill the SNP’s coffers. In less than a year’s time, it will be fighting a general election against a resurgent Labour party – Yousaf’s first electoral test. The SNP is also under investigation by Police Scotland over allegations – denied by the SNP – that it misappropriated £600,000 in donations for an independence campaign. It emerged last year that Murrell had lent the party £107,000 to help bridge a day-to-day spending shortfall. The party says it has since paid Murrell back. Yousaf said on Monday he had not yet been briefed about those challenges: until his election as SNP leader, he had no right to know about them, he said. He now needs to rebuild his party’s finances. Over the next 24 hours, Yousaf must appoint his first cabinet and perhaps reshape some portfolios. That includes appointing a deputy first minister – Sturgeon’s highly trusted deputy John Swinney has already resigned, after 16 years in government. It is an essential role; it often involves being the first minister’s enforcer. Yousaf pledged to appoint an equal number of men and women to his cabinet and across junior ministerial posts, following Sturgeon’s lead. He confirmed on Tuesday to reporters his deputy will be a woman: Shona Robison, a close friend of Sturgeon’s and the former employer of Yousaf’s wife, Nadia El-Nakla, who is now an SNP councillor. The urgent task of reuniting the party after the bruising battles he had with rivals Kate Forbes and Ash Regan were made harder after Forbes turned down his offer late on Tuesday of a cabinet post covering rural affairs – a significant demotion from her current role as finance secretary.

His new cabinet will be revealed on Thursday. On Thursday, Yousaf will host his inaugural session of first minister’s questions – the climax of the week at Holyrood. After first becoming a junior minister in 2012, he has had more than a decade of experience answering MSPs’ questions but this is different. Here he must master every ministerial brief, every controversy and be on guard for a curve-ball question from opposition leaders. Aides and civil servants will spend hours preparing detailed briefing notes, often working late into the night on Wednesdays, before briefing the first minister on Thursday. Opposition leaders are relishing their weekly confrontations with Yousaf: he had a torrid time as a minister, and was blamed for numerous policy failures – including by his erstwhile colleagues in the SNP. They believe the SNP is now in unavoidable decline, and that Yousaf is its weakest point. ",Controversial

"Duke of Sussex and other high-profile claimants, including Doreen Lawrence, are making allegations of illegal behaviour by Associated Newspapers Prince Harry has joined with Doreen Lawrence and five other high-profile individuals in bringing legal action against Associated Newspapers, the parent company of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday. They allege the newspapers engaged in various illegal activities in order to obtain information for use in news stories. The seven individuals allege many forms of illegal information gathering were carried out on behalf of the Mail or Mail on Sunday. The allegations of illegal behaviour include voicemail interception, the tapping of landline telephones, the blagging of private medical records by pretending to be the individual in question, and even commissioning breaking and entry into private property. Most of the allegations suggest the illegal behaviour was carried out by external private investigators instructed by journalists at the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, rather than by reporters directly employed by the newspapers. Each of the individuals is making similar but separate allegations of illegal behaviour by Associated Newspapers. Harry says they obtained information resulting in articles on his personal life, including details of his relationship and feelings towards ex-girlfriends. Doreen Lawrence alleges the Daily Mail hired private investigators to hack her phone and obtain information on her murdered son. Elton John claims that the newspaper obtained a copy of his child’s birth certificate before he had seen it. Sadie Forst alleges landline calls were intercepted and used as the basis of news stories. The full list of allegations is extensive. The claims of illegal behaviour mainly cover a period from 1993 to 2011. During this time Paul Dacre, who is in line for a peerage in Boris Johnson’s resignation honours list, was editor of the Daily Mail. He has always denied that his newspaper engaged in illegal activity. Associated Newspapers has called the allegations “preposterous smears”. According to the claimants, they only recently learned they may be victims of illegal information gathering by individuals working for the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday. They argue they could not have brought the case earlier because they did not know they were potentially victims. The cases are being heard in a civil court, rather than a criminal court, because the cases have been brought by the alleged victims rather than a prosecution by the state after a police investigation. It’s more than a decade since the Guardian reported on the widespread use of phone hacking at the News of the World, leading to the closure of the Sunday tabloid. This resulted in the Leveson inquiry into press ethics and a series of court cases against Rupert Murdoch’s News UK and the parent company of the Daily Mirror. Collectively those two newspaper groups have paid out hundreds of millions of pounds in damages and legal fees to people whose phones were hacked. Although phone hacking has largely faded from public consciousness, hundreds of cases continue to work their way through the court system, including several against the Sun. Associated Newspapers has always denied that it engaged in illegal reporting tactics, with Dacre giving an assurance under oath to the Leveson inquiry to that effect. Until now the company has largely escaped the expensive and reputationally damaging court cases that have dogged its tabloid newspaper rivals over the last two decades. Harry and the other individuals bringing the cases against the Mail filed their legal claims at the start of October but it has taken five months for them to reach court. This week’s hearing is not a full trial with witnesses. Instead, it is a preliminary hearing where the Mail’s lawyers are attempting to stop the cases progressing any further – essentially asking a judge to chuck out the case at an early stage and avoid a very public and messy trial where lots of evidence would be disclosed. The prominent individuals have purposefully used their celebrity status to attract attention to the case. Harry flew in from the US to attend the technical legal hearing, causing the world’s media to cover it. Sadie Frost, Elton John, David Furnish and Doreen Lawrence also attended the first day of the hearing. Associated Newspapers successfully asked a judge to stop other media outlets from naming 73 journalists who are named in the legal claims. All the individuals work – or used to work – for the company’s newspapers. The legal argument was, in part, based on the Human Rights Act’s guarantee of the right to a fair trial – a piece of legislation that the Daily Mail has often criticised in its newspapers. The judge agreed with Associated Newspapers that it would be unfair to release the names of the journalists at this stage because they may be unable to offer up a defence if the case does not go to trial. Associated Newspapers is objecting to the cases on two grounds. First, it alleges that the claims are largely based on material that was provided in confidence to the Leveson inquiry back in 2011. These documents, setting out payments by the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday to private investigators, were then leaked to a news website, which in turn passed it to the lawyers bringing the cases against Associated Newspapers. Associated Newspapers claims that the material provided to the Leveson inquiry is subject to a legal order, which means it has to remain confidential. The claimants feel otherwise and want to use the material. Second, Associated Newspapers argues that Harry and the other individuals have waited too long to bring the claims. Individuals have six years after learning they are potential victims to file a case. Associated Newspapers says that Harry and the other claimants only began proceedings in October 2022 but must have all had a reasonable suspicion that they were potential victims of illegal behaviour by Associated Newspapers prior to 2016, meaning they missed the six-year deadline. In the words of the Mail publisher’s lawyers, the cases are therefore “stale” and should be stopped from going to trial. ",Provoking

"About 9,000 of the people who arrived in Britain since the fall of Kabul are still living in temporary accommodation Since the fall of Kabul in August 2021, 22,833 people have arrived in the UK from Afghanistan, nearly all of whom had at least one family member who served with the British authorities. Nearly 18 months later, about 9,000 are still living in temporary accommodation Many Afghan refugees arriving in the UK have been or continue to be housed in bridging hotels – temporary accommodation while a permanent home can be sourced. Hundreds of Afghans in Kensington, including 150 children, have been told they must move to Yorkshire this week. They are refusing to move. These are run by the Home Office and were booked by the department in August 2021 when the evacuation began. While local authorities do not directly run the hotels, some councils have taken on responsibility to provide residents of the hotel with support. No. Many Afghans came to the UK believing that they might be found accommodation quickly by the Home Office but it has proved to be very difficult. Under “operation warm welcome”, Afghans were supposed to get support to “ensure that those who worked closely with the British military and UK government in Afghanistan, and risked their lives in doing so, get the vital health, education, support into employment and accommodation they need to fully integrate into society”. Yes. There was already a housing crisis in the UK; many of the Afghan families are larger than an average family – sometimes up to 10 members – and require more bedrooms than the average property; and affordable places tend to be out of large cities and away from Afghan communities and friends. Afghan refugees have told the Guardian that they also received many messages of false hope over the first year – promises from Home Office staff that they would be out of their hotels in a few months. It didn’t happen. No. While the infrastructure is some of the hotels is on paper luxurious, the reality is that once the hotels are taken over by the Home Office, many of the extra services such as gyms, swimming pools and room service are off limits. There is no room service and the food tends to be doled out from large pans, not a la carte. Certainly not. One family had lived for 14 months with a husband, a wife, a 14-month-old and a three-year-old in a single room. Others were living with six people in a room. Many have complained that living in such cramped conditions, and eating the same food over and over again has become very stressful. They complain about skin conditions, lice, vomiting bugs, depression and anxiety. There is nowhere for children to play or study. From August, Afghans were encouraged by the Home Office to try and find private rented accommodation as it became apparent that the Home Office was unlikely to be able to find accommodation for them. Sign up to First Edition Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning after newsletter promotion Once an Afghan refugee finds a suitable property, they are supposed to get it signed off by the receiving council. Most are working and can pay for it themselves, but if not, they can seek benefits or financial help from government, Nevertheless, the Home Office has been slow in responding to requests for approval and the process is very confusing. In many cases, private rented landlords do not wait for the Home Office to respond but rent out their properties to other tenants who can take up the tenancy at pace. Jo Underwood, the head of strategic litigation at Shelter, said she had seen many Afghan families thwarted in their search for private accommodation by slow processes in the Home Office. “We have had clients who have found eight or nine properties, gone back to the Home Office and have heard nothing,” she said. “And then the properties go. “The frustration is that there is a scheme in place which should work. But it just does not work at all well.” The obvious reason is cost to the taxpayer. Council sources have told the Guardian that the Home Office is keen to move all Afghans out of inner city hotels by the end of the year. They are unable to rent a private property because most Afghans brought to the UK have low income and no credit history. They are unable to build credit history because they have no permanent address. ",Sad

"New leader needs to convince Scotland that he can take the SNP in a fresh direction The first act of Humza Yousaf’s leadership of the SNP was to fire off a letter to Rishi Sunak demanding a section 30 order which, if granted, would trigger the mechanism to allow a second Scottish independence referendum to go ahead. His predecessor, Nicola Sturgeon, had already tried this in 2017 and again in 2019, but her approach failed when the UK government refused to agree to it. Downing Street has already made it clear that Sunak’s response to Yousaf will be no different. Even some of his allies were left shrugging their shoulders and struggling to explain how the bid was anything other than performative. “He’s got to show he’s prepared to do that,” one said of Yousaf. “Even if we all already know the outcome.” During the leadership campaign, Yousaf indicated that another independence referendum was not going to happen anytime soon, with the polls suggesting that a majority of Scottish voters do not want one now, and the public still split on the outcome. He has already suggested he is “not wedded” to the idea of using the next general election as a de facto referendum, after the idea opened a deep schism within the SNP, forcing Sturgeon to drop it. He has warned that the independence movement should not become stuck in a “quagmire” of process, but instead the party has to talk about policy, effectively restarting the yes campaign, pounding the pavements to try to win more undecided or novoters over. Allies suggest that Yousaf, the first Scottish Asian and Muslim to become first minister, understands that to win over new voters, when most already hold fairly entrenched positions, he first has to convince them of the economic case. That will involve responding to some of the still unanswered questions of the campaign, including on currency, and showing competence on handling the nation’s finances and boosting growth. “Then you’re in a different place,” said one SNP insider. Yet his opponents suggest that if there was any real hope of another independence referendum, Sturgeon would still be in post. They claim that she knew that she had run out of road after the supreme court ruled against another vote and internal splits on the de facto referendum, and so had to pass on the baton. Yousaf is also on a collision course with the UK government over the SNP’s gender reform plans, currently blocked by Sunak. He initially said he would take legal action, but then suggested he would only proceed if the advice suggested he could win. If, as expected, the case is weak then he will have to face up to the realpolitik and compromise. He needs to convince the Scots electorate that, despite being the “continuity Sturgeon” candidate throughout the leadership contest, he can actually take the SNP in a fresh direction, and prove wrong his detractors – who say he is just more of the same, but not as good. It will involve countering his rival Kate Forbes’s attack that he was incompetent in the three policy briefs he held. Yousaf’s allies suggest he has been underestimated but admit it is up to him to demonstrate his talents. They say he understands there are challenges ahead, and will have to adopt a “continuity-plus” strategy to win over previously unconvinced voters, as well as keep those already on board. Sign up to First Edition Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning after newsletter promotion But he has a tougher electoral challenge ahead than the SNP has faced in years, with Labour already snapping at his heels before next year’s general election. Sturgeon’s departure presented a huge opportunity for Keir Starmer, who unsurprisingly has made several trips to Scotland in recent weeks. If Labour does well there, picking up a couple of dozen seats, it could be the difference between just squeaking into power or doing it with a workable majority. Yousaf also neutralises the perennial Tory attack advert that depicts the Labour leader in the SNP’s pocket, as he lacks the profile of either of his predecessors. SNP insiders acknowledge the threat Labour represents to them for the first time in a generation. But there remain significant areas of difference – such as Brexit and migration – where they can set themselves apart. Nevertheless, Yousaf does not have long to prevent his coalition of support from splintering. ",Controversial

"Tory critics of PM’s plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda say failure could do lasting damage to party Rishi Sunak’s proposed bill – which hopes to fulfil his promise to “stop the boats” – is part of a significant gamble which aims to pull off an unexpected Conservative win at the next general election. The prime minister is claiming he can break the business model of human traffickers by sending asylum seekers to central Africa in their thousands. If all the pieces fall into place – and his supporters admit there are many pieces – the bill will pass through parliament, legal challenges against the plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda will be dismissed by UK and Strasbourg courts, the Rwandan government will build homes for thousands of asylum seekers and an airline will be found to fly them. His team have taken some hope from a fall in the number of Albanian people travelling by small boat to the UK after a deportation deal was struck with the government in Tirana just before Christmas. This is evidence, they say, that people entering the UK will change their behaviour if they see planes taking off for Kigali. Even if the plan fails, Sunak’s allies say, voters in crucial “red wall” seats and beyond will remember that the Conservatives were willing to take a hard line on immigration in the face of Labour opposition. But speak to Sunak’s many critics, both inside and outside the Conservative party, and they believe that the bill could – in the long term – damage the Tories if it fails to materialise. Tory former ministers have said Sunak’s plan is destined to fail, and is ultimately a cynical ploy to create clear blue water between the Conservative party and Labour. “There is no evidence that the Rwanda plan will succeed unless tens of thousands of asylum seekers are sent there. And there is no capacity in Rwanda to do that,” one said. Labour plans to combat the Conservative position by hammering home the fact there have been repeated promises to curb migration since 2010, as the numbers who have crossed the Channel in small boats has soared. The Conservatives under Boris Johnson passed a law nine months ago which they claimed would stop the boats, end hotel use and penalise people for trying to claim asylum. Instead, boat crossings increased to a record 45,000 compared with just a few hundred people three years ago, the numbers held in hotels went up, asylum delays increased and only 1% of last year’s cases have so far been decided. Sign up to First Edition Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning after newsletter promotion Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, also plans to argue that the bill is a “traffickers’ charter” because it prevents women forced into sex work from accessing support. It will also criminalise people from Afghanistan who worked alongside the British army who have no alternative route to the UK other than by boat. The bill is expected to face tougher tests in the Commons before it is passed to the Lords and into law. It faced criticism from both wings of Sunak’s own party in the hours before being debated on Monday, with MPs from the right receiving reassurances that the European courts will not be able to intervene to stop flights to Rwanda in future. Meanwhile, the Conservative former minister Tim Loughton told the Commons he would push his plans for required safe and legal routes to a vote unless there were “substantial reassurances” from the government. “I will be prepared to move to a vote unless I can have some substantial reassurances from the government … it makes a requirement on the face of the bill that there will be safe and legal routes as part of this legislation going through,” he said.

"Having styled himself as the continuity candidate, the leadership contest has highlighted how much needs to change inside the party After a bracingly close result that raises fundamental questions about the core priorities of the wider party membership, Humza Yousaf begins his tenure as the Scottish National party’s first ethnic minority leader, and soon to be first Muslim first minister of Scotland, with a distinct set of challenges. Immediately after the leadership announcement, there was evident relief particularly from those younger, progressive activists who had dreaded the success of the socially and fiscally conservative Kate Forbes. Campaign groups such as Back Off Scotland, which presses for protest-free buffer zones outside abortion clinics, tweeted their approval. But others made plain their consternation that such a sizeable chunk of their fellow members were willing to set aside Forbes’ personal opposition to equal marriage and abortion, for example, in order to vote for her “reset” platform. Two-fifths of SNP members on first preferences were convinced by a candidate who was highly critical of Nicola Sturgeon’s record, challenging the outgoing first minister’s model of progressive taxation and the speed of transition away from oil and gas exploration. More than 50% of first preferences votes were for candidates – Forbes and third-placed Ash Regan – who were relaxed about ditching the governing partnership with the Scottish Greens. The question remains: to what extent does the wider membership subscribe to Nicola Sturgeon’s progressive consensus, and what does “progressive” mean to them? While garnering the majority of parliamentary endorsements from councillors, MSPs and MPs, Yousaf fell short of a whole-hearted endorsement from the wider membership and as such has work to do now to earn their trust. As much as the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, decries Yousaf’s lack of electoral mandate, his mandate within the party itself is also slim. Forbes made it clear in her remarks following the announcement that Yousaf needs to listen to those members who supported her and Regan – while it remains to be seen whether Forbes, should she remain in cabinet, would support his plans for wealth taxes. But more engaged activists suggest that, while Forbes benefited from name recognition with the wider membership, those who have had the opportunity to work more closely with Yousaf also respect him. One experienced activist explained: “I’ve seen him step in to help with internal party issues over the years when he didn’t have to, because he cared about people being treated fairly. As an equalities activist I’ve never had to explain why something mattered. Working with him you realise he’s very on the ball and far from the buffoonish media caricature.” With both Yousaf and Forbes calling for a switch from process to policy on independence strategy, one in 10 SNP members on first preferences were attracted to Regan’s more immediate plans for a referendum, the cohort who have been repeatedly frustrated by Sturgeon’s repeated promises to hold another vote. An hour after the result, Alex Salmond’s Alba party launched a recruitment drive based around Forbes’ slogan “continuity won’t cut it”. Yousaf must convince members that his gradualist approach is not more of the same – and instantly pledged to ask the UK government for the required section 30 order to hold a fresh referendum, a performative gesture given the certainty Westminster would refuse. Having styled himself as the continuity candidate, what has emerged from the contest is how much needs to change inside the party. The campaign has signalled the end of “wheesht for indy” – all-pervasive internal discipline that meant frustrations about party management or policy were cut off in order to maintain focus on the main prize. The resignation of the SNP chief executive, Peter Murrell – Sturgeon’s husband – in a damaging transparency row over membership figures brought other concerns into the open about imposition of HQ-approved candidates, poor handling of harassment complaints and member consultation. There is now a clamour for reform, which Yousaf must heed alongside an overflowing in-tray in government – including huge pressure on the first minister’s £60bn annual budget, record NHS waiting lists and looming emissions targets. By mid-April, he must also decide whether to contest the UK government’s block on Holyrood’s gender recognition bill. Just as pressingly, Yousaf needs to imprint himself on the minds of voters beyond his SNP base, many of whom will be more familiar with criticisms of his record as health minister and capacity for gaffes, after the latest Ipsos Scotland polling found that his predecessor remains far more popular than any of the three candidates who were vying to succeed her, and that Forbes is more popular with general voters. Despite the relentless racist and Islamophobic abuse he has encountered since he entered public life, Yousaf told the Guardian recently he believes fundamentally that Scotland is a progressive country. Just as Sturgeon spoke of the significance for girls and young woman across the country when she was elected first minister in 2014, Yousaf’s acceptance speech included an invitation to pause and absorb the significance of this moment as the grandson of Muslim migrants from Pakistan steps up to the highest office.

"Court appearance in privacy claim should not come as a surprise given prince’s loathing for Associated Newspapers The sight of Prince Harry marching up the steps of the high court on Monday came as a shock. On the agenda was a pre-trial legal hearing in his claim against the Daily Mail publisher Associated Newspapers. This was not promising material for a courtroom drama. But Harry’s presence suddenly changed that, as news alerts were pinged out to mark his “surprise” court visit. In hindsight it should not have come as such a surprise. The prince has repeatedly expressed his loathing for the British press and the Mail in particular. He raged against the title in his much-hyped book Spare, and has vowed to crusade against it. His presence in court will be seen as a sign that he is not bluffing. Pre-trial hearings – where barristers argue over a series of technical legal points – are not normally box-office material. There were no witnesses called to give evidence on Monday morning at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, no big revelations, and a lot of legal arguments over the status of material provided under the Inquiries Act (2005). Harry could have snuck in a side entrance. Instead he chose to walk in through the front gate, using the media he hates to draw global attention to this early technical hearing in his battle against the Mail. Harry’s vendetta against Associated Newspapers is deeply personal. At times it can even sound like a life and death struggle. His dislike of the tabloid press in general began when his mother was killed. Harry claims she was hounded to her death by the paparazzi and their press masters. “I don’t want history to repeat itself,” he said. But he fears it may. At one point in Spare he says that after “torturing my mother … they would be coming for me.” In more recent years his fear and loathing has become more focused. He writes that the Mail “took the lead” in the media’s treatment of Meghan. He singled out its headline: “Harry’s girl is (almost) straight outta Compton” as “disgraceful”. He also noted that the Mail later carried a column by Rachel Johnson that referred to Meghan’s “exotic DNA”. Harry characterised the column as “predicting that Meg would do something genetically to the royal family”. Associated Newspapers has previously said its portrayal of Meghan has been much more positive than Harry states and has published an opinion column that highlighted its “welcoming and sympathetic” coverage. Harry also blames the Mail for ruining his and Meghan’s plans to live away from the royal family, first in Oxfordshire and then in Canada. In a Netflix documentary Harry claimed the stress of Meghan’s privacy action against the Mail on Sunday caused her to miscarry. “I believe my wife suffered a miscarriage because of what the Mail did. I watched the whole thing,” he said. Harry is part of a group of seven prominent claimants – including Elton John, Doreen Lawrence and Sadie Frost – collectively alleging widespread illegality at the Mail’s titles. In an ITV interview in January, Harry’s friend Tom Bradby questioned the wisdom of taking on the might of the Mail. Bradby said: “The stakes I would say are very high, you’re suggesting you know, they [the Mail] hired private investigators to break into people’s houses to plant a listening device, I mean this is off the scale, they deny it absolutely. Let’s be clear, you would owe them a pretty abject apology if you’re not right.” Harry’s reply was defiant: “Well if it wasn’t … they would presumably sue us,” adding: “Who’s policing them?” Harry feels this role of policing the media is his duty despite a warning from his father that it would be “suicide” to take on the press. He told Bradby: “I will continue to serve my country from abroad, and changing the media, who I believe is at the epicentre of so many of the problems across the UK where people are suffering, then I’m going to try and make a difference. And it may be incredibly hard, and I don’t know how long it’s gonna take, but it is 100% worth it.” Harry was joined in court by Frost, John, and David Furnish – all of whom are also bringing cases against the Mail’s publisher. But John and his husband chose to avoid the same media scrum through the front gate. Harry and Frost sat one seat apart from each other in the busy courtroom. The royal appeared in no mood to settle. He sat at the back of the courtroom during the technical legal hearing, taking sips from a Pret a Manger bottle of water and making notes in a small notepad while browsing his phone. Speaking when the legal action was launched against it in October, Associated Newspapers denied the allegations. A spokesperson said: “We utterly and unambiguously refute these preposterous smears which appear to be nothing more than a pre-planned and orchestrated attempt to drag the Mail titles into the phone-hacking scandal concerning articles up to 30 years old. “These unsubstantiated and highly defamatory claims – based on no credible evidence – appear to be simply a fishing expedition by claimants and their lawyers, some of whom have already pursued cases elsewhere.” ",Provoking

"Area supports an abundance of species, from rare and endangered birds to seagrass meadows Poole harbour is one of the most strictly protected environmental areas in the UK and Europe, but as the frantic clean-up taking place on Monday showed, it is not immune to pollution from oil spills. As a site of special scientific interest, a European special area of conservation and a marine protection zone, the harbour and its waters support an abundance of species, from rare and endangered birds to the seagrass meadows in its waters that are carbon sinks. Dr Simon Boxall, of the school of ocean and earth science at the University of Southampton, said quick and decisive action was needed, with longer-term monitoring to measure the impact of the spill. At 200 barrels, it was a relatively small spill, but was leaking into the shallow coast close to environmentally sensitive areas. He said it had the potential to cause substantive damage before it dispersed and broke down. “It will be important to collect as much of the oil as possible in the forthcoming hours and to boom off harbours and sensitive areas,” he said. The oil spill occurred at a pipeline operated by the gas company Perenco, at Wytch Farm oilfield. It showed that even with onshore drilling, “where there’s drilling, there’s spilling,” said Ian Williams, professor of applied environmental science at the University of Southampton. “Oil spills have a wide range of well-documented adverse impacts on land, oceans, coastlines, rivers, seabeds and more,” he said. “Oil has the potential to destroy habitats and disrupt the natural ecosystems that make up these environments. [Oil spills] are particularly damaging to areas that are sensitive or protected such as Poole harbour.” Research by the University of Newcastle has revealed such oil spills are not isolated in the UK. Prof Richard Davies, pro-vice chancellor of the global and sustainability department, said the research found leakage from oil and gas well boreholes, and sometimes from the associated pipelines, had caused nine pollution incidents between 2000 and 2013, according to Environment Agency data. Caroline Dennett, who resigned as a safety consultant for Shell, which is not involved in this oilfield, after accusing the oil company of causing “extreme harms” to the environment, said the spill was environmentally devastating.

When this happens here it really brings home the impact.” The oil spill came a week after Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council voted to request the Dorset Pension Fund to divest from fossil fuels. Dennett said the spill should feed an appetite to put a stop to the Wytch Farm production site. “They only serve the global market and its greedy shareholders,” she said. ",Sad

"Host of Blind Date and Blankety Blank described as someone who stuck up for the underdog – particularly if they were canine Television stars, human rights campaigners, the queen consort and animal rights charities have paid tribute to the entertainer Paul O’Grady, who has died aged 67. O’Grady, who brought one of the first drag acts to television as Lily Savage, died “unexpectedly but peacefully” on Tuesday evening. His appearance in drag on popular television shows in the 1990s meant he was seen as a “trailblazer” and “the most important person in British culture for drag”. The campaigner Peter Tatchell told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that O’Grady was “fierce in his beliefs and principles” and went out of his way to help people. “He wasn’t one of these people where celebrity went to his head. He was still very down to earth. Whenever someone was in need, Paul O’Grady stepped in to offer help. He was such a kind, generous humanitarian.” Recalling O’Grady’s politics, Tatchell said: “He was a fierce opponent of the Thatcher government over its attacks upon the LGBT+ community, particularly section 28. And he was appalled by the levels of police harassment that were still going on, right through the 1990s.” In a statement, Buckingham Palace said Camilla had a special bond with O’Grady and worked closely with him in their support of Battersea Dogs & Cats Home. She will be sharing her sympathies with O’Grady’s family privately, the palace said. The royal family’s official Twitter account paid tribute to O’Grady, posting an image of Camilla with the star. It read: “Deeply saddened to hear of the death of Paul O’Grady, who worked closely with her majesty in support of Battersea, providing lots of laughter and many waggy-tailed memories.” The former host of Blind Date, The Paul O’Grady Show and Blankety Blank was described by friends as someone who stuck up for the underdog – even (especially) if they happened to be canine. The presenter Carol Vorderman told the BBC that O’Grady was a “massive talent” who “made every part of you feel like you were alive”. She added: “He never judged the vulnerable, never judged the weak, never judged the misunderstood. He fought for them like a lion.” O’Grady was born in Birkenhead in 1955, moved to London in his 20s and began his career as a social worker in Camden. He was discovered at a club in south London when he stood in for an act that called in sick, playing the drag persona Lily Savage, a loud-mouthed single mother and occasional sex worker. He retired Savage to “a convent in Brittany” in 2004. O’Grady’s husband, Andre Portasio, said in a statement: “It is with great sadness that I inform you that Paul has passed away unexpectedly but peacefully yesterday evening. Portasio, who married O’Grady in a low-key ceremony in 2017, added: “He will be greatly missed by his loved ones, friends, family, animals and all those who enjoyed his humour, wit and compassion. I know that he would want me to thank you for all the love you have shown him over the years.” Sign up to The Guide Get our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every Friday after newsletter promotion The comedian and writer Sandi Toksvig said: “Working with Paul O’Grady was one of the greatest pleasures of my life. Funny, fearless and full of rage. The best. The world seems a little less bright.” The drag artist Danny Beard told BBC Breakfast that O’Grady was a “trailblazer” and “the most important person in British culture for drag, for the queer community”. “I don’t think there’s anyone who does the job that I do that doesn’t class Paul as an icon,” the winner of the fourth series of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK added. O’Grady’s affection for animals was so great, he once said that given the choice of more sex or money, he would choose a mongoose. He and Portasio shared their Kent farmhouse with four dogs, goats, sheep, chickens and barn owls. Last year, he hosted a special episode of For the Love of Dogs, his show on ITV, with Camilla, the queen consort, to mark 160 years of Battersea Dogs & Cats Home. The charity’s chief executive, Peter Laurie, said: “Battersea will forever remember Paul as a devoted animal lover with the biggest heart, who fell head over heels in love with every dog he met at our centres.” ",Sad

"Husband announces ‘unexpected but peaceful’ death of personality who was known for his drag persona Lily Savage Paul O’Grady, the beloved TV presenter and comedian who broke on to the scene with his drag act persona Lily Savage, has died at the age of 67. His husband, Andre Portasio, confirmed in a statement that O’Grady died “unexpectedly but peacefully” on Tuesday evening. “We ask, at this difficult time, that whilst you celebrate his life you also respect our privacy as we come to terms with this loss,” Portasio said in a statement. “He will be greatly missed by his loved ones, friends, family, animals and all those who enjoyed his humour, wit and compassion. “I know that he would want me to thank you for all the love you have shown him over the years.” Days ago, O’Grady had finished a stint playing Miss Hannigan in the musical Annie and was set to resume the role in performances around the UK and Ireland later this year. Tributes poured in early on Wednesday. “Such sad news,” TV presenter Lorraine Kelly wrote on Twitter. “Paul O’Grady – funny, fearless, brave, kind and wise ... I always think dogs are the best judge of character and they ADORED him.” The LGBTQ+ rights campaigner Peter Tatchell remembered O’Grady as “one of the loveliest people you could ever meet. Everyone whose lives he touched will miss him greatly, as will those who enjoyed his wit and admired his compassion”. Born in Birkenhead in 1955, O’Grady moved to London in his 20s and worked as a social worker for Camden council. By 1978, he was developing his drag act Lily Savage in gay clubs, basing the loud-mouthed single mother and occasional sex worker on female relatives. O’Grady came to mainstream attention in 1991 when he was nominated for the Perrier award, the UK’s most prestigious comedy prize, and began appearing on radio and television as himself. O’Grady retired Savage – to “a convent in Brittany” – in 2004. During his career, he hosted Bafta-winning talkshow The Paul O’Grady Show, Blankety Blank, celebrity gameshow Paul O’Grady’s Saturday Night Line Up and the reboot of Blind Date, taking over the reins from the show’s long-running presenter and his close friend Cilla Black, who died in 2015. A well-known animal lover who kept dogs, pigs, bats, ferrets and more at his farm in Kent, O’Grady also presented the award-winning show For The Love Of Dogs. Last year he was joined by the queen consort in a special one-off episode to mark 160 years of Battersea Dogs & Cats Home, an organisation for which he was an ambassador. He was also a patron of Orangutan Appeal UK and won an RSPCA Animal Hero award for his “outstanding contribution to animal welfare”. Throughout his career he was famously outspoken about the neglect of care workers, austerity and the Tory party: he made headlines when he said he wanted to see David Cameron and George Osborne’s “heads on spikes on Tower Bridge” over austerity cuts, and revealed that he quit his talkshow because celebrities were so dull they were like “relatives you felt obliged to visit”. In August last year, O’Grady presented his final BBC Radio 2 show, having hosted the Sunday afternoon programme for nearly 14 years. In his final show, he said it was “one of the longest jobs I’ve ever held down. I only came to do a few hours for Elaine Paige and look what happened.” O’Grady wrote a four-volume memoir and in 2008 he was awarded an MBE for his services to entertainment. When described as a national treasure in an interview with the Observer in 2017, he responded: “Oh, what a terrible phrase. That wasn’t planned.” O’Grady is survived by his husband, his daughter, Sharon, and two grandchildren. ",Sad

"Commissions for ‘pre-party to end all pre-parties’ include monument covered in sandbags, mass kite-fly and ‘queer fantasia’ A 200-year-old bronze statue commemorating Nelson’s victory at the Battle of Trafalgar is to be surrounded by thousands of sandbags to echo the plight of monuments in Ukraine. The plan for Liverpool’s Nelson’s Monument is one of 24 cultural commissions announced on Tuesday as part of a festival that aims to transform the city in the run-up to its staging of the Eurovision song contest. Running from 1-14 May, it will, say the organisers, be “the pre-party to end all pre-parties” as fans from across the world descend on the city. Claire McColgan, the director of Culture Liverpool, said the planned EuroFestival would be a “scouse/Ukrainian mashup of brilliance”. She added: “No other Eurovision host city has ever curated a creative programme of such scale and scope. This is the spirit of Eurovision spilling on to our streets. Free for all. Accessible to all. Uniting us all.” In arts festival commissioning terms, EuroFestival has been brought together at lightning speed. There was a call-out in December that brought more than 700 submissions from artists across Europe. Fifty were shortlisted and 24 have been chosen – 19 of them collaborations between UK and Ukrainian artists. They include Protect the Beats, in which Liverpool’s Nelson Monument will be surrounded by 2,500 sandbags to replicate the way monuments in Ukraine are being enveloped to protect them from bombardment. Inside the structure there will be screens showing a documentary on the importance of music in Ukraine, including soldiers singing on the frontline and late-night raves in Kyiv’s metro stations. Esther Simpson, of the arts group Whispered Tales, said the idea was to create a poignant artwork that transformed a city landmark. “As an artist who has lived in Liverpool for the past 10 years I know how the city’s streets continuously vibrate to a variety of beats due to its rich musical heritage … We can’t wait to be a part of EuroFestival.” Festival organisers said one of the most ambitious projects would be one called Soloveiko Songbird – the national bird of Ukraine and “a symbol of song and happiness”. In English the birds are nightingales and the idea is to have 12 large, lit-up nightingale sculptures across the city. Each will have unique plumage and audio representing different regions of Ukraine. The hope is that people will follow the full trail of songbirds. Another trail will be With Fire and Rage, an immersive audio experience and “smartphone adventure” accessed via QR codes located around the city. It will include music concerts in metro stations during air raids and puppet shows that were livestreamed from bomb shelters.

The Bluecoat gallery will have an exhibition of work by the Liverpool-based artist Ellie Hoskins and the Ukrainian artist Alevtina Kakhidze, both of whom use humour to observe the world around them. From 8-10 May, there will be a three-day “queer fantasia” at Chavasse Park including the “best and wurst of Eurovision” – a day of drag and cabaret paying homage to all things Eurovision. Jamala, the Ukrainian singer-songwriter who won the Eurovision song contest in 2016, will premiere her new album of music based around Crimean Tatar folk songs. It will be the first full performance of the album and she will be accompanied by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra. She said it was a record she and her team “literally saved from the rubble last year” and one that preserved “the beauty and greatness” of her home culture. “During these dark times for Ukraine, the presentation of the new album in Liverpool is an essential mission for me,” she said. “Just like the most precious memories of our lives, we cherish our culture as the most valuable treasure.” ",Inspirational

"Many of the buildings are in deprived areas, say Save Aberdeen Libraries, while Aberdeen City Council argues facilities will be moved to cheaper ‘hubs’ Six of Aberdeen’s libraries will close this week after a last-ditch effort to save them was unsuccessful. However, the Save Aberdeen Libraries campaign – an umbrella group bringing together campaigns to save Cornhill, Cults, Ferryhill, Kaimhill, Northfield and Woodside libraries – has said it is considering legal action against Aberdeen City Council, according to the Herald. A special meeting on Monday saw the council discuss the closure of six libraries, along with Bucksburn Swimming Pool. Protesters gathered outside the council offices and handed over petitions to save the libraries, hoping for an eleventh-hour reprieve. But councillors decided the closures would go ahead, meaning the libraries will shut on 1 April. As well as petitions, campaigners had previously demonstrated outside Woodside and Cornhill libraries and staged a read-in at Ferryhill library. A love letter campaign was also held for Cults, Ferryhill and Woodside libraries, in recognition that many in local communities are unable to sign online petitions. Save Aberdeen Libraries said it had received support from writers including Peter May, Stuart MacBride, Kirstin Innes and Damian Barr. Crime writer Ian Rankin has retweeted information from the campaign, while author Kerry Hudson tweeted: “Aberdeen libraries were a literal lifesaver & refuge for my vulnerable family growing up.

The council has argued that while it may be closing the library buildings, library facilities and services will not be reduced. SNP councillor John Cooke said at a community meeting that books and stock from the libraries will be moved into “hubs” at schools and community centres, according to the Press and Journal. “We’re closing buildings, we’re not reducing library facilities and services,” the newspaper reported him as saying. “For example, the one in Torry – we’re closing the building but the Torry library service will go into a hub in the school two minutes walk away. “We’re closing buildings which are old, expensive to heat and need staff, so we’re co-locating the service in schools and community centres.” ",Controversial

"Bectu launches safer theatres charter as survey reveals 45% of workers may quit due to shocking levels of antisocial behaviour by drunken theatregoers UK theatre staff have been attacked, sexually harassed and abused by drunken audience members during performances, a new survey has revealed. Front of house staff facing violent assaults, theatregoers urinating in fire exits and mass brawls breaking out in auditoriums were among the incidents uncovered by the report from the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Communications and Theatre union (Bectu). With fears that antisocial behaviour at shows is on the rise, it has called for venues across the UK to sign up to a new charter to help protect workers. Almost 90% of theatre staff said that they had experienced or witnessed bad audience behaviour, while more than 70% believed the issue has worsened since the Covid pandemic. Shockingly, nearly one-third of respondents said they had been involved in or witnessed an incident where a venue had to call the police, with 20% having feared for their safety at least once. “I have been physically assaulted by a patron who then caused further problems while security tried to remove her,” an anonymous theatre worker said. “I couldn’t come in to work for a while due to the effect it had on me and then, even longer still, I couldn’t go into the auditorium.” Another said: “The younger women in my theatre, including myself, were regularly sexually harassed by male audience members. We had to introduce a code word to be used in radio communications as we felt so unsafe.” A common theme among theatre staff was dealing with drunk audience members, with the police having to be called out to venues in many cases. One worker said: “A brawl broke out at a jukebox musical involving 20 or so drunk people. [It was] a dispute over some people singing along to the show. Security, police and ambulances [were] involved.” More than 1,500 theatre staff – including those working in front of house, hospitality, box office, stage door, sound and lighting – took part in the survey, with respondents working across all types of shows. Almost half (45%) said they had considered leaving the industry due to poor audience behaviour. One worker, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that they believe theatregoers drinking alcohol before arriving for shows was a big reason for disorder. “Because the price of drinks is high, people tend to come preloaded or smuggle things in,” they said, adding that the worst offenders included hen parties. “We’ve had people refusing to leave, people hitting the fire alarm on their way out. There’s been assaults, too; staff being grabbed, swung for and even, on occasion, people acting inappropriately and being creepy.” Philippa Childs, head of Bectu, said the survey demonstrated that bad and aggressive behaviour was not limited to any one type of theatre and is happening across all forms of performing arts, including opera and ballet. “I’m shocked by the number of incidents and the extreme nature of some of them,” she said. “It is now very clear that there is an issue, which the industry needs to address and take steps to resolve. “Some of the lowest-paid people work in the industry. Nobody should go to work and face those issues. It is really concerning to me that people think this is acceptable when they go for a night out. “The threats of physical violence are particularly worrying, although none of the things described should be happening. We are really concerned for the health and safety of our members.” One of the key findings in the report was 90% of theatre workers feeling people arriving to shows drunk was a contributing factor in declining audience behaviour. Childs said: “I’m sure quite a lot of it is drink-related. When people are intoxicated, their barriers come down and they behave in a way that they wouldn’t normally. I do also think more broadly there is an issue about how society speaks to people in public-facing roles. “I don’t know if it is post-pandemic rage but it does seem that people have forgotten how to be nice and respectful when people are at work.” She added that venues and theatre management companies ought to do more to “set clear expectations” of what is expected from audiences, with other issues raised including theatregoers filming, talking loudly and rustling sweet packets during performances. Bectu is launching a Safer Theatres Charter in the UK, demanding theatre management companies do more “to provide a safe environment for audiences and workers”.

It is also calling for theatre management companies to provide staff with necessary training and to ensure “adequate and safe staffing levels”. “I have been spat at for refusing entry – their group did not have enough tickets for the performance and we did not have any available seats to put them in.” “My colleague was punched in the back of her leg while trying to assist a drunk person with getting out of their seat. She was then threatened and almost choked.” “Sexually assaulted by a patron. I have been kissed on my neck by a very drunk patron.” “Been scared to walk to my car after a shift as customers told me they would wait for me. Had my staff abused and racially abused. Mostly for telling people to stop singing or because people were drunk or had taken illegal substances.” “People have stated that because of how expensive their ticket was they are ‘entitled’ to act in a certain way.” ",Sad

"The Paddington Bear Experience, a family-friendly show based on Michael Bond’s character, will be at the ex-GLC building on the South Bank The world of Michael Bond’s irrepressible, marmalade-loving bear Paddington is to be re-created for an immersive theatre experience at London’s County Hall. Audiences will be invited to explore the environs of 32 Windsor Gardens, where Paddington settles with the Brown family after arriving from Peru, including an array of familiar settings from Bond’s books. Opening later this year, The Paddington Bear Experience will unfold across a space of 26,000 sq ft at the building, a former local government headquarters, on the Thames. The production is designed by Immersive Octopus, the creative collective behind Peaky Blinders: The Rise, which runs in London until May and brings to life the violent world of the gangster TV series. The beloved, accident-prone Paddington – famous for his blue duffel coat and battered red hat, often concealing a sticky sandwich – will star in a considerably more family-friendly affair. Designer Rebecca Brower, who has been working on the Path Entertainment Group’s show for six months, said its multi-sensory, interactive mix of games, live performance and video content “works for all ages” – from young cubs to great aunts. Written by Katie Lyons, the experience has a narrative built around helping the Brown family prepare for a special occasion. “We don’t want to give too much away,” said Brower, adding that the appearance of Paddington himself will be part of the surprise. “I can say that Paddington is present but I can’t say yet how he will be present,” she said with a laugh. Fans of the Paddington books and cartoons will find all sorts of “hidden nods” to those worlds around the experience but Brower said that the aesthetic is mostly inspired by the two live-action films, in which Ben Whishaw voiced a CGI Paddington, released in 2014 and 2017. “I read the books as a kid,” said Brower. “When the films came out, I really fell in love even more with the character.” She visited some of the London locations used in the films and aims to achieve a realistic design while presenting the capital with a similar “sort of magic that they brought into quite a grey city”. Immersive Octopus’s previous productions include Doctor Who: Time Fracture, which opened in 2021. Brower created those designs during the Covid-19 pandemic, which required endless adjustments for different levels of social restrictions. After Covid rules were lifted, Peaky Blinders: The Rise was a way to “reach out to audiences who had been longing to come together and have a party”. Immersive theatre is currently booming, with the Bridge’s production of the musical Guys and Dolls letting theatregoers intermingle with the actors and even dance with them for the show’s finale. Post-pandemic, many audiences crave “more than just sitting and watching a show” said Brower, who is designing interactive rooms where you can “touch everything, open drawers and cupboards, and climb into places and do stuff”. With themed food promised as part of the entertainment, that could well include enjoying your own marmalade sandwich. The County Hall production of Agatha Christie’s courtroom thriller Witness for the Prosecution will continue to run alongside The Paddington Bear Experience.

"Sarah Mantell’s script awarded Susan Smith Blackburn prize, beating plays by Zadie Smith, Kimber Lee and Ruby Thomas The American playwright Sarah Mantell has won this year’s Susan Smith Blackburn prize for their play In the Amazon Warehouse Parking Lot. Written for a cast of seven female, non-binary and transgender actors, all aged over 50, the play is described by Mantell as exploring “queer ageing, capitalism, campfires and falling in love as the world ends”. It follows a group of itinerant warehouse workers on their night shifts as they search for people they have lost. The 10 finalists for the prize included four plays recently staged in the UK: Zadie Smith’s The Wife of Willesden, Ruby Thomas’s Linck & Mülhahn, Maryam Hamidi’s Moonset and Anupama Chandrasekhar’s The Father and the Assassin. When Mantell wrote the play, they said, “my wildest dream was that it would become something my generation of actors could age towards. There are so few roles for women, trans and non-binary actors in the second half of their careers, when many of them are just hitting the peak of their ability.” Winning the prize, they added, means “it suddenly seems like that wild dream is possible”. Almost 200 plays were submitted for consideration for the award for female, transgender and non-binary playwrights, which has run since 1978. Mantell wins a cash prize of $25,000, and a signed limited-edition print by the artist Willem de Kooning. The nine finalists each receive an award of $5,000. They include Katie Holly (Her Hand on the Trellis), Karen Hartman (New Golden Age), Kimber Lee (saturday), Francisca Da Silveira (Pay No Worship) and ak payne (Amani). The judging panel for this year’s prize comprised Cabaret director Rebecca Frecknall, producer Eleanor Lloyd, actor Lucian Msamati, playwright Julia Cho, choreographer Raja Feather Kelly and actor Amy Ryan.

"Catherine Scarlett responds to an article about US teenagers who claim to have proved the theorem using trigonometry While it is heartening to see enthusiastic mathematical inquiry in young people and the academic community encourage teenagers, it is not possible to prove Pythagoras’s theorem using angle trigonometry (US teens say they have new proof for 2,000-year-old mathematical theorem, 24 March). That is because the basic definitions of sines and cosines are derived from Pythagoras’s theorem, so using them in any way to derive the theorem is therefore using circular reasoning.
